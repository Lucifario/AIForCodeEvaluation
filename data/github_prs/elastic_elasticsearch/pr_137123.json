This means all 9.x versions are documented on the same page and published off of the main branch, instead of creating separate pages for each minor version.\n\nWe use [applies_to tags](https://elastic.github.io/docs-builder/syntax/applies) to mark version-specific features and changes.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for a quick overview</summary>\n\n### When to use applies_to tags:\n✅ At the page level to indicate which products/deployments the content applies to (mandatory)\n✅ When features change state (e.g. preview, ga) in a specific version\n✅ When availability differs across deployments and environments\n\n### What NOT to do:\n❌ Don't remove or replace information that applies to an older version\n❌ Don't add new information that applies to a specific version without an applies_to tag\n❌ Don't forget that applies_to tags can be used at the page, section, and inline level\n</details>\n\n### 🤔 Need help?\n- Check out the [cumulative docs guidelines](https://elastic.github.io/docs-builder/contribute/cumulative-docs/)\n- Reach out in the [#docs](https://elastic.slack.com/archives/C0JF80CJZ) Slack channel",
