Well, it just doesn't... \n * Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object.\n * In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application.\n * <p>\n * However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy: \n * dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.)\n * However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.\n * <p>\n */\npublic class CallsRealMethods implements Answer<Object>, Serializable {\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 9057165148930624087L;\n\n    public Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\n        return invocation.callRealMethod();\n    }\n}", "review": {"response": "{\n  \"bugs\": [\n      {\n         \"type\": \"Potential Issue\",\n         \"description\": \"The class is implementing the Answer interface, but it's not annotated with @Override for the answer method.
