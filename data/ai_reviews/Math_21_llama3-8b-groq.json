In a sense, this is the square root of A.</p>\n * <p>The difference with respect to the regular {@link CholeskyDecomposition}\n * is that rows/columns may be permuted (hence the rectangular shape instead\n * of the traditional triangular shape) and there is a threshold to ignore\n * small diagonal elements. This is used for example to generate {@link\n * org.apache.commons.math3.random.CorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator correlated\n * random n-dimensions vectors} in a p-dimension subspace (p < n).\n * In other words, it allows generating random vectors from a covariance\n * matrix that is only positive semidefinite, and not positive definite.</p>\n * <p>Rectangular Cholesky decomposition is <em>not</em> suited for solving\n * linear systems, so it does not provide any {@link DecompositionSolver\n * decomposition solver}.</p>\n *\n * @see <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CholeskyDecomposition.html\">MathWorld</a>\n * @see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition\">Wikipedia</a>\n * @version $Id$\n * @since 2.0 (changed to concrete class in 3.0)\n */\npublic class RectangularCholeskyDecomposition {\n\n    /** Permutated Cholesky root of the symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. */\n    private final RealMatrix root;\n\n    /** Rank of the symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. */\n    private int rank;\n\n    /**\n     * Decompose a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix.\n     *\n     * @param matrix Symmetric positive semidefinite matrix.\n     * @param small Diagonal elements threshold under which  column are\n     * considered to be dependent on previous ones and are discarded.\n     * @exception NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException if the matrix is not\n     * positive semidefinite.\n     */\n    public RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(RealMatrix matrix, double small)\n        throws NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException {\n\n        final int order = matrix.getRowDimension();\n        final double[][] c = matrix.getData();\n        final double[][] b = new double[order][order];\n\n        int[] swap  = new int[order];\n        int[] index = new int[order];\n        for (int i = 0;
