If a type parameter instead ranges over only non-null\n   * types (or if the type is a non-variable type, like {@code String}), then code should almost\n   * never use this method, preferring instead to call {@code requireNonNull} so as to benefit from\n   * its runtime check.\n   *\n   * <p>An example use case for this method is in implementing an {@code Iterator<T>} whose {@code\n   * next} field is lazily initialized. The type of that field would be {@code @Nullable T}, and the\n   * code would be responsible for populating a \"real\" {@code T} (which might still be the value\n   * {@code null}!) before returning it to callers. Depending on how the code is structured, a\n   * nullness analysis might not understand that the field has been populated. To avoid that problem\n   * without having to add {@code @SuppressWarnings}, the code can call this method.\n   *\n   * <p>Why <i>not</i> just add {@code SuppressWarnings}? The problem is that this method is\n   * typically useful for {@code return} statements. That leaves the code with two options: Either\n   * add the suppression to the whole method (which turns off checking for a large section of code),\n   * or extract a variable, and put the suppression on that. However, a local variable typically\n   * doesn't work: Because nullness analyses typically infer the nullness of local variables,\n   * there's no way to assign a {@code @Nullable T} to a field {@code T foo;} and instruct the\n   * analysis that that means \"plain {@code T}\" rather than the inferred type {@code @Nullable T}.\n   * (Even if supported added {@code @NonNull}, that would not help, since the problem case\n   * addressed by this method is the case in which {@code T} has parametric nullness -- and thus its\n   * value may be legitimately {@code null}.)\n   */\n  @ParametricNullness\n  @SuppressWarnings(\"nullness\")\n  static <T extends @Nullable Object> T uncheckedCastNullableTToT(@Nullable T t) {\n    return t;\n  }\n\n  private NullnessCasts() {}\n}\n",
