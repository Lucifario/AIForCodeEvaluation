  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: In the convertClassesToClassNames method, the stream is not properly checked for null elements. This can lead to a NullPointerException when trying to call getName() on a null object.\n   Suggested Fix: classes.stream().filter(Objects::nonNull).map(e -> getName(e, null)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n2. Explanation: In the convertClassNamesToClasses method, the Class.forName() method is called with a potentially null className. This can lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: if (className != null) { try { classes.add(Class.forName(className)); } catch (Exception ex) { classes.add(null); } }\n3. Explanation: The NAME_PRIMITIVE_MAP and PRIMITIVE_WRAPPER_MAP maps are not properly synchronized. This can lead to concurrent modification exceptions if multiple threads try to access these maps simultaneously.\n   Suggested Fix: synchronized (ClassUtils.class) { NAME_PRIMITIVE_MAP.put(Boolean.TYPE.getName(), Boolean.TYPE); ... }",
