  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The get method returns a new ImmutableList instance every time it is called, which can lead to performance issues and memory leaks if the list is large. This is because ImmutableList instances are not cleared when they are no longer referenced.\n   Suggested Fix: Change the get method to return a shared instance of the ImmutableList, or use a different data structure that is more memory-efficient.\n2. Explanation: The contains method does not handle null values correctly. It will throw a NullPointerException if the object being searched for is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check at the beginning of the contains method to return false if the object is null.\n3. Explanation: The get method does not handle out-of-bounds indices correctly. It will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of bounds, but it does not provide any additional information about the error.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a more informative error message to the get method to indicate that the index is out of bounds.",
