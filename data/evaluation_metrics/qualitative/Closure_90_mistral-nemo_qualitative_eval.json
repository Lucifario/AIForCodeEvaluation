This could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.\\n\\n2. **BAD_IMPLEMENTED_TYPE**: There's a check for `BAD_IMPLEMENTED_TYPE`, suggesting that the function might be implementing a type that is not a valid interface or object type. This could result in compilation errors or incorrect behavior.\\n\\nTo fix these issues, ensure that all types used in the function are properly defined and resolved before using them.\"}]",

It correctly points out the presence of UNKNOWN_TYPE and BAD_IMPLEMENTED_TYPE, which are valid concerns. However, it does not provide specific code examples or detailed steps to resolve these issues, which reduces its actionability. The review does not delve deeply into the root causes of these issues, nor does it address any security implications. It is constructive in suggesting that types should be properly defined and resolved, but it lacks concrete examples or steps. The review adheres to the guidelines by focusing on the technical aspects without delving into style issues."

        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies that `UNKNOWN_TYPE` and `BAD_IMPLEMENTED_TYPE` are potential issues. However, it's extremely superficial. The code *uses* these constants; the review doesn't analyze *why* they might be encountered or how to prevent it. It simply states the obvious: that having unknown or badly implemented types is bad. The suggestion to 'ensure all types are properly defined' is incredibly vague and unhelpful. There's no attempt to understand the context of these type checks within the `FunctionTypeBuilder`. Security isn't addressed at all. The review is constructive in that it points out potential problems, but lacks depth. It perfectly adheres to any implicit guideline of not suggesting code changes (it only offers general advice)."
