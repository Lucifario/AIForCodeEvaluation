  "original_review": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to review this Java code for bugs. The user provided a snippet from the Apache Commons Lang library's ArrayUtils class. My task is to find any bugs and return them in a JSON format with a 'bugs' list.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through the code. The code seems to be a part of the ArrayUtils class, which has various utility methods for arrays. The user's code cuts off at the end of the toString method, but maybe there's a bug there.\n\nLooking at the toString method:\n```java\npublic static String toString(Object array) {\n    return toString(array, \"{}\");\n}\n```\nAnd then there's another method:\n```java\n/**\n * <p>Outputs an array as a Str``` (the comment is cut off)\n */\n```\nWait, the code provided by the user ends abruptly in the middle of a method's Javadoc comment. The actual method might be incomplete. For example, the second toString method is only declared with a parameter and the return type, but the implementation is missing. The user's code shows:\n```java\npublic static String toString(Object array, String stringIfNull) {\n    // implementation here?\n}\n```\nBut in the provided code, the second toString method isn't fully present. The user's code cuts off at \"Str```\", which might be a typo or incomplete Javadoc. However, in the actual Apache Commons Lang code, this method is present and properly implemented. But given that the user's code is cut off, maybe that's an issue? Or perhaps it's a copy-paste error from the user's side.\n\nWait, the user's code ends with:\n```\n * @return a String representation of the array, '{}' if null array input\n */\npublic static String toString(Object array) {\n    return toString(array, \"{}\");\n}\n\n/**\n * <p>Outputs an array as a Str``` \n```\nThe second method's Javadoc is cut off, and the method body is missing. That's definitely a problem. The method is declared but not implemented. So in the user's provided code, there's a method declaration without a body. That would be a syntax error. For example, the method:\n```java\npublic static String toString(Object array, String stringIfNull) {\n    // missing implementation\n}\n```\nBut in the user's code, that method isn't even declared\u2014it's only the Javadoc and the method signature up to the parameters. The actual method body is missing. So this is a bug because the code is incomplete. However, in the real Apache Commons Lang code, this method is present and implemented. But since the user's provided code is cut off, this is a problem in their version.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that the Javadoc for the second toString method is incomplete. The line says \"Outputs an array as a Str```\", which is probably a typo or incomplete. The correct Javadoc should explain the parameters and return value, but it's missing.\n\nSo the bugs here are:\n\n1. The method toString with two parameters (Object array, String stringIfNull) is declared but has no implementation. This is a syntax error because Java requires method bodies unless it's an abstract method or interface. Since ArrayUtils is a concrete class, this would cause a compilation error.\n\n2. The Javadoc for the second toString method is incomplete, which is a documentation bug, not a functional one, but might be considered a bug depending on the context.\n\nAdditionally, I should check other parts of the code. For example, the class has a public constructor, which is allowed for JavaBeans, but the class is supposed to be used with static methods. However, that's more of a design choice rather than a bug unless there are instances where the constructor is not properly called or causes issues. But in the provided code, the constructor is correctly defined.\n\nAnother thing to check: the EMPTY_... arrays are declared as public static final, which is correct for constants.\n\nSo the main bug is the missing method body for the toString method with two parameters. The user's code is cut off, leading to an incomplete method. That's a syntax error and a bug.\n\nWait, looking again at the user's provided code. The code they provided ends with:\n\n```\n/**\n * <p>Outputs an array as a Str``` \n * ...\n */\npublic static String toString(Object array, String stringIfNull) {\n    // ... ?\n}\n```\n\nBut in the user's code, the method is not present. The code they provided cuts off in the middle of the Javadoc comment and the method declaration. So in the code they provided, the method is declared but has no body. For example, in their code, after the first toString method, they have:\n\n```\npublic static String toString(Object array) {\n    return toString(array, \"{}\");\n}\n\n/**\n * <p>Outputs an array as a Str``` \n * ...\n */\npublic static String toString(Object array, String stringIfNull) {\n```\n\nBut the method body is missing. The user's code ends there. So in this case, the method is declared but not implemented. That's a syntax error. So that's a bug.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first toString method, they call toString(array, \"{}\"), but if the method with two parameters is not implemented, this would cause a compile error. So both methods are problematic.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the parameters: the method with two parameters is supposed to take a String for when the array is null, but if the method is not implemented, that's a problem.\n\nSo the main bugs are:\n\n- The method toString(Object array, String stringIfNull) is declared but has no implementation (syntax error).\n- The Javadoc for that method is incomplete (documentation bug).\n\nOther possible issues: Are there any other methods that are incomplete? The user's code is cut off, so perhaps other methods are also missing. However, based on the provided code, only the toString methods are shown with this issue.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should list these two bugs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bugs\": [\n    {\n      \"line\": 214,\n      \"message\": \"Method 'toString(Object array, String stringIfNull)' is declared but has no implementation, causing a syntax error.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"line\": 212,\n      \"message\": \"Incomplete Javadoc comment for the 'toString' method; documentation is missing or cut off.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
