  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method nullToEmpty and emptyToNull delegate to Platform.nullToEmpty and Platform.emptyToNull respectively. However, there is no guarantee that these methods will always be implemented correctly in all platforms. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the implementation of these methods changes in the future.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider implementing the nullToEmpty and emptyToNull methods directly in the Strings class to avoid any potential issues with platform-specific implementations.\n2. Explanation: The method repeat creates a new array of characters and then uses System.arraycopy to copy the characters from the original string to the new array. This could potentially lead to an OutOfMemoryError if the string is very large and the repeat count is also very large.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a StringBuilder to build the repeated string instead of creating a new array of characters. This would avoid the need for System.arraycopy and reduce the risk of an OutOfMemoryError.\n3. Explanation: The methods commonPrefix and commonSuffix do not handle the case where the input strings are null. This could lead to a NullPointerException if either of the input strings is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add null checks to the methods commonPrefix and commonSuffix to handle the case where the input strings are null.",
