  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The class is annotated with @Immutable, but the fields are not final. This is a potential bug as the class can be modified after it's created.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the @Immutable annotation or make the fields final.\n2. Explanation: The class has a lot of static final fields, which can lead to a large memory footprint. Consider using a more efficient data structure or a configuration file.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a configuration file or a more efficient data structure.\n3. Explanation: The class has a lot of methods that perform string manipulation, which can be slow for large strings. Consider using a more efficient library or algorithm.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a more efficient library or algorithm.\n4. Explanation: The class has a lot of magic numbers, which can make the code harder to understand. Consider defining constants for these numbers.\n   Suggested Fix: Define constants for the magic numbers.\n5. Explanation: The class has a lot of methods that perform regex operations, which can be slow for large strings. Consider using a more efficient library or algorithm.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a more efficient library or algorithm.",
