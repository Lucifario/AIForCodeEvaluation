Explanation: The `populateTypeMappings` method does not handle the case where `from` is a `GenericArrayType` and `to` is not.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for `GenericArrayType` and handle it accordingly.\n2. Explanation: The `populateTypeMappings` method does not handle the case where `from` is a `ParameterizedType` and `to` is a `WildcardType` with a lower bound.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for `ParameterizedType` and handle the lower bound of the `WildcardType` accordingly.\n3. Explanation: The `where` method does not check if the `mappings` parameter is null before using it.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for `mappings` and throw an exception if it is null.\n4. Explanation: The `where` method does not check if the `formal` parameter is a type variable before using it.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure `formal` is a type variable and throw an exception if it is not.\n5. Explanation: The `where` method does not check if the `actual` parameter is a type before using it.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure `actual` is a type and throw an exception if it is not.",
