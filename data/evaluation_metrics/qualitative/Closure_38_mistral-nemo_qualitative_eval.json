        "reasoning": "The review is factually correct; it accurately identifies unimplemented abstract methods and logical inconsistencies. However, the actionability is moderate. While it points out *what* is missing or incorrect, it doesn't offer suggestions on *how* to implement them (e.g., what source mapping entails, how to best handle line breaks). The analytical depth is shallow; it identifies issues but doesn't explore the broader implications of these missing implementations. Security isn't addressed at all, which is reasonable given the context, but warrants a low score. Constructiveness is moderate; it's mostly pointing out deficiencies without offering alternative approaches. The review adheres to any implicit guidelines (no style complaints, focused on functionality/logic)."
