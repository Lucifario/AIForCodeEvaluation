  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a large number of enum values. This can lead to performance issues and make the code harder to maintain. It would be better to group related enum values together or consider using a different data structure.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a separate class or enum for related capabilities, or use a data structure like a map to store capabilities and their corresponding enum values.\n2. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a mix of enum values with and without the @Deprecated annotation. This can lead to confusion and make it harder to maintain the code. It would be better to remove the @Deprecated annotation from enum values that are not deprecated.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the @Deprecated annotation from enum values that are not deprecated.\n3. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a large number of enum values that are not used anywhere in the code. This can lead to performance issues and make the code harder to maintain. It would be better to remove unused enum values.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove unused enum values from the class.",
