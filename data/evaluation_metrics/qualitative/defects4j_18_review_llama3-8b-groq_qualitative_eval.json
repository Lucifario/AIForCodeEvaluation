  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The class CMAESOptimizer has multiple fields with default values. However, these default values are not being checked or validated anywhere in the code. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the default values are not suitable for the specific use case.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a constructor that takes all the fields as parameters and validate the default values. This will ensure that the default values are being used correctly and prevent unexpected behavior.\n2. Explanation: The class CMAESOptimizer has a field 'random' which is not being used anywhere in the code. This field is also not being validated or checked for null.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the unused field 'random' or add a check to ensure that it is not null before using it.\n3. Explanation: The class CMAESOptimizer has a field 'boundaries' which is not being validated or checked for null. This can lead to a NullPointerException if the field is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that the field 'boundaries' is not null before using it.\n4. Explanation: The class CMAESOptimizer has a field 'inputSigma' which is not being validated or checked for null. This can lead to a NullPointerException if the field is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that the field 'inputSigma' is not null before using it.\n5. Explanation: The class CMAESOptimizer has a field 'dimension' which is not being validated or checked for null. This can lead to a NullPointerException if the field is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that the field 'dimension' is not null before using it.",
