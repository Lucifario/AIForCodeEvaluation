        "reasoning": "The review is generally accurate and provides valuable insights. It correctly identifies potential issues such as input validation, precision loss, and standard compliance. The suggestions are actionable, though they could be more specific (e.g., providing examples of how to implement the additional rounding step). The review shows a good understanding of the code's design and potential pitfalls. However, it does not explicitly address security risks, which is a missed opportunity. The review is constructive and adheres to the guidelines, providing a balanced assessment without nitpicking."

        "reasoning": "The review identifies valid potential issues based on the provided documentation and context. The points about input validation, precision loss, and IEEE 854 compliance are reasonable concerns given the stated goals of the library. The style and documentation points are also valid. However, the actionability is low because the line numbers are all '0' and the descriptions are high-level. It's difficult to directly address the issues without knowing *where* in the code they manifest. The analytical depth is moderate; it identifies potential problems but doesn't delve into the code to confirm or provide specific solutions. Security awareness is minimal as the review doesn't address any security vulnerabilities. The review is constructive, offering areas for improvement rather than just criticism. It perfectly adheres to the implicit guideline of not making changes to the code itself, only providing feedback."
