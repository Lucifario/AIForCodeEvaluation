However, it lacks actionable suggestions for fixing these issues and does not address security concerns. The review is constructive in pointing out problems but could be more helpful by providing solutions. It adheres to the guidelines by focusing on technical issues without commenting on style."

        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies missing method overrides, which is a critical bug. It also points out a potential numerical stability issue in `cumulativeProbability` by suggesting handling extreme values, demonstrating analytical depth. The suggestions are very actionable - the developer knows exactly which methods need to be implemented/modified. The review is constructive, focusing on what's missing or could be improved rather than being purely negative. Security isn't relevant in this code snippet. The review doesn't violate any constraints (none were specified). The line and column numbers are accurate, making it easy to locate the issues."
