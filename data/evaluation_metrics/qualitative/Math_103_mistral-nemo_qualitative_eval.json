        "reasoning": "The review identifies several valid issues. The infinite loop concern in `inverseCumulativeProbability` is plausible given the potential behavior of the superclass method without proper bounds checking. The domain bound calculations are also correctly identified as needing adjustment to represent the infinite nature of the normal distribution. The NaN check for standard deviation is a good catch. The actionability is high as the issues are clearly pinpointed with line numbers. Analytical depth is moderate; it identifies *what* is wrong but doesn't deeply explore the consequences of the infinite loop or the impact of incorrect domain bounds on other calculations. Security awareness is low, as none of these issues directly relate to security vulnerabilities. The review is constructive, focusing on improvements rather than just pointing out flaws. It adheres to the implicit guideline of focusing on code quality and correctness."
