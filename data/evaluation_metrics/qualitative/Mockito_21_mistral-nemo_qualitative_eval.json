        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies potential issues with constructor availability and exception handling. All three points are factually accurate. Actionability is moderate; the review points out *what* is wrong but doesn't offer specific code to fix it (e.g., how to validate constructor parameters). Analytical depth is also moderate; it identifies the problems but doesn't delve into *why* these scenarios might occur frequently or suggest more robust solutions (like reflection caching). Security awareness is low, as the code doesn't appear to have direct security implications. The review is constructive, focusing on improving the robustness of the code rather than just criticizing it. It doesn't appear any guidelines were violated."
