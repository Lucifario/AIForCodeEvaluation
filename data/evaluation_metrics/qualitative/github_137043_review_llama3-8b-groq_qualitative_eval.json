  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method `isNotUnitVector` does not handle the case where the magnitude is NaN (Not a Number). This can lead to unexpected behavior when checking if a vector is a unit vector.\n   Suggested Fix: return Float.isNaN(magnitude) || Math.abs(magnitude - 1.0f) > EPS;\n2. Explanation: The `DEFAULT_HNSW_EARLY_TERMINATION` constant is not used anywhere in the code. It's likely a leftover from a previous implementation and should be removed.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the `DEFAULT_HNSW_EARLY_TERMINATION` constant and its usage.\n3. Explanation: The `HNSW_FILTER_HEURISTIC` setting does not handle the case where the index version is not on or after a specific version. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to get the filter heuristic.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the index version and return a default filter heuristic if it's null.",
