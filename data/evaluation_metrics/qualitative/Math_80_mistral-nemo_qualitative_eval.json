        "reasoning": "The review is empty (bugs: []). This isn't necessarily *bad*, as the code appears well-structured and follows established numerical methods (as indicated by the comments referencing Dhillon's thesis and LAPACK routines). \n\n* **Factual Correctness (5):**  The code itself doesn't present any immediately obvious factual errors. The comments suggest a solid foundation in established algorithms.\n* **Actionability (4):** While there are no bugs reported, the code is generally well-written and easy to understand. Suggestions could be made about adding more comments to explain the purpose of each variable, but that's more about readability than correctness.\n* **Analytical Depth (3):** The code implements a complex algorithm. A deeper review would involve analyzing the numerical stability and performance characteristics, but that's beyond the scope of a simple code review without specific performance concerns.\n* **Security Awareness (1):** There's no apparent security vulnerability in this code, but the review doesn't mention security at all.  Numerical code can be susceptible to issues like overflow or underflow, which *could* be exploited, but this isn't a primary concern here.\n* **Constructiveness (4):** The lack of bugs doesn't mean the review is unhelpful. It implicitly acknowledges that the code is well-written. More constructive feedback could be provided, but the code is already in good shape.\n* **Adherence to Guidelines (5):** The code adheres to standard Java coding conventions and the provided Apache license header."
