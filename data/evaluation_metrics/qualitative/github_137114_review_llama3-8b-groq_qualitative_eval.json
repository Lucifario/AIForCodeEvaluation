  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method 'canRecover' is not defined in the provided code snippet. It's used in multiple places without being declared.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a method 'canRecover' to the StoreRecovery class to check if the shard can be recovered.\n2. Explanation: The 'internalRecoverFromStore' method is not defined in the provided code snippet. It's used in multiple places without being declared.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a method 'internalRecoverFromStore' to the StoreRecovery class to handle the actual recovery process.\n3. Explanation: The 'recoveryListener' method is not defined in the provided code snippet. It's used in multiple places without being declared.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a method 'recoveryListener' to the StoreRecovery class to create a recovery listener.\n4. Explanation: The 'addIndices' method is not defined in the provided code snippet. It's used in the 'recoverFromLocalShards' method without being declared.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a method 'addIndices' to the StoreRecovery class to add indices to the recovery process.\n5. Explanation: The 'recoverFromStore' method does not handle the case where the 'indexShard' is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'indexShard' in the 'recoverFromStore' method.\n6. Explanation: The 'recoverFromLocalShards' method does not handle the case where the 'shards' list is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'shards' in the 'recoverFromLocalShards' method.\n7. Explanation: The 'recoverFromLocalShards' method does not handle the case where the 'mappingUpdateConsumer' is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'mappingUpdateConsumer' in the 'recoverFromLocalShards' method.\n8. Explanation: The 'recoverFromLocalShards' method does not handle the case where the 'outerListener' is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'outerListener' in the 'recoverFromLocalShards' method.",
