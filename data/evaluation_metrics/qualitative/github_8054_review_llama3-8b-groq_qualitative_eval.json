  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The incidentEdges method does not handle the case where the node is removed from the graph after the method is called, leading to an IllegalStateException.\n   Suggested Fix: To fix this, we need to add a check in the incidentEdges method to see if the node has been removed from the graph. If it has, we should throw a more informative exception, such as NodeRemovedException.\n2. Explanation: The incidentEdges method does not handle the case where the node is re-added to the graph after having been removed, leading to undefined behavior.\n   Suggested Fix: To fix this, we need to add a check in the incidentEdges method to see if the node has been re-added to the graph. If it has, we should throw a more informative exception, such as NodeReaddedException.\n3. Explanation: The incidentEdges method does not handle the case where the node is not an element of the graph, leading to an IllegalArgumentException.\n   Suggested Fix: To fix this, we need to add a check in the incidentEdges method to see if the node is an element of the graph. If it's not, we should throw a more informative exception, such as NodeNotFoundException.",
