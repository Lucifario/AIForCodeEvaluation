Explanation: The `putAll` method does not check for null values in the map being copied.\n   Suggested Fix: public void putAll(Map<? extends K, ? extends Long> m) {\n    if (m != null) {\n        m.forEach(this::put);\n    }\n}\n2. Explanation: The `updateAndGet` and `getAndUpdate` methods do not handle the case where the updater function throws an exception.\n   Suggested Fix: public long updateAndGet(K key, LongUnaryOperator updaterFunction) {\n    try {\n        return map.compute...\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // handle exception\n    }\n}\n3. Explanation: The `accumulateAndGet` and `getAndAccumulate` methods do not check if the accumulator function is null.\n   Suggested Fix: public long accumulateAndGet(K key, long x, LongBinaryOperator accumulatorFunction) {\n    if (accumulatorFunction == null) {\n        throw new NullPointerException(\"accumulatorFunction is null\");\n    }\n    return updateAndGet(key, oldValue -> accumulatorFunction.applyAsLong(oldValue, x));\n}",
