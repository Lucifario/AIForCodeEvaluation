The parameter 'allocationService' is not checked for null before being used.\n   Suggested Fix: allocationService = Objects.requireNonNull(allocationService, \"allocationService cannot be null\");\n2. Explanation: The class MetadataCreateIndexService has a potential resource leak. The ThreadPool is not closed in the constructor.\n   Suggested Fix: threadPool = Objects.requireNonNull(threadPool, \"threadPool cannot be null\");\n3. Explanation: The class MetadataCreateIndexService has a potential security issue. The forbidPrivateIndexSettings flag is not checked before being used.\n   Suggested Fix: if (forbidPrivateIndexSettings) { // add security checks here }\n4. Explanation: The class MetadataCreateIndexService has a potential memory leak. The indexSettingProviders set is not cleared in the constructor.\n   Suggested Fix: indexSettingProviders = new HashSet<>();",
