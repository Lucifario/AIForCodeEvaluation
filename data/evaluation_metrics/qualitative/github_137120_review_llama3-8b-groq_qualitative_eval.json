  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The constructor SearchableSnapshotAction(String snapshotRepository, boolean forceMergeIndex) is missing the required parameters totalShardsPerNode and replicateFor, which are not null in the other constructors.\n   Suggested Fix: Add default values for totalShardsPerNode and replicateFor to the constructor SearchableSnapshotAction(String snapshotRepository, boolean forceMergeIndex):\npublic SearchableSnapshotAction(String snapshotRepository, boolean forceMergeIndex) {\n    this(snapshotRepository, forceMergeIndex, 1, null);\n}\n2. Explanation: The constructor SearchableSnapshotAction(String snapshotRepository) is missing the required parameters totalShardsPerNode and replicateFor, which are not null in the other constructors.\n   Suggested Fix: Add default values for totalShardsPerNode and replicateFor to the constructor SearchableSnapshotAction(String snapshotRepository):\npublic SearchableSnapshotAction(String snapshotRepository) {\n    this(snapshotRepository, true, 1, null);\n}\n3. Explanation: The method parse(XContentParser parser) does not handle the case where the input is not a valid XContentParser.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a try-catch block to handle the IOException that may be thrown by the XContentParser:\npublic static SearchableSnapshotAction parse(XContentParser parser) {\n    try {\n        return PARSER.apply(parser, null);\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        // handle the exception\n    }\n}\n4. Explanation: The class SearchableSnapshotAction does not implement the equals and hashCode methods, which are necessary for proper object comparison.\n   Suggested Fix: Implement the equals and hashCode methods in the class SearchableSnapshotAction:\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    SearchableSnapshotAction that = (SearchableSnapshotAction) o;\n    return Objects.equals(snapshotRepository, that.snapshotRepository) &&\n           Objects.equals(forceMergeIndex, that.forceMergeIndex) &&\n           Objects.equals(totalShardsPerNode, that.totalShardsPerNode) &&\n           Objects.equals(replicateFor, that.replicateFor);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic int hashCode() {\n    return Objects.hash(snapshotRepository, forceMergeIndex, totalShardsPerNode, replicateFor);\n}",
