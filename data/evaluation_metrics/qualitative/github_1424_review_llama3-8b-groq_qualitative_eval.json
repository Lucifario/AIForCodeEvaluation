Explanation: The class is not thread-safe due to the static variables used in the class.\n   Suggested Fix: Make the class thread-safe by using ThreadLocal variables or by synchronizing access to the static variables.\n2. Explanation: The class is not immutable due to the static variables used in the class.\n   Suggested Fix: Make the class immutable by removing the static variables or by making them final.\n3. Explanation: The class uses a Pattern object that is not thread-safe.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a thread-safe Pattern object or synchronize access to the Pattern object.\n4. Explanation: The class uses a static final String object that is not thread-safe.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a thread-safe String object or synchronize access to the String object.\n5. Explanation: The class uses a static final int object that is not thread-safe.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a thread-safe int object or synchronize access to the int object.",
