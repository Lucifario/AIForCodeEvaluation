The 'nodesInfo' object is not checked for null before calling its methods.\n   Suggested Fix: if (nodesInfo != null) { // call methods on nodesInfo }\n2. Explanation: TransportGetSnapshotsAction does not handle the case where the 'snapshots' object is null. This could lead to a null pointer exception.\n   Suggested Fix: if (snapshots != null) { // call methods on snapshots }\n3. Explanation: TransportClusterHealthAction does not check for null 'clusterHealth' object before calling its methods. This could lead to a null pointer exception.\n   Suggested Fix: if (clusterHealth != null) { // call methods on clusterHealth }\n4. Explanation: TransportNodesStatsAction does not handle the case where the 'nodesStats' object is null. This could lead to a null pointer exception.\n   Suggested Fix: if (nodesStats != null) { // call methods on nodesStats }\n5. Explanation: TransportClusterRerouteAction does not check for null 'clusterReroute' object before calling its methods. This could lead to a null pointer exception.\n   Suggested Fix: if (clusterReroute != null) { // call methods on clusterReroute }",
