This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling `substring` method: `return targetBeanName != null && targetBeanName.startsWith(TARGET_NAME_PREFIX) ? targetBeanName.substring(TARGET_NAME_PREFIX_LENGTH) : null;`\n2. Explanation: The method `createScopedProxy` does not check if the `definition` is `null` before calling `definition.getBeanName()` method. This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling `definition.getBeanName()` method: `if (definition != null) { String originalBeanName = definition.getBeanName(); ... }`\n3. Explanation: The method `createScopedProxy` does not check if the `targetDefinition` is `null` before calling `targetDefinition.getBeanDefinition()` method. This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling `targetDefinition.getBeanDefinition()` method: `if (targetDefinition != null) { BeanDefinition targetBeanDefinition = targetDefinition.getBeanDefinition(); ... }`\n4. Explanation: The method `createScopedProxy` does not check if the `proxyDefinition` is `null` before calling `proxyDefinition.getPropertyValues().add()` method. This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling `proxyDefinition.getPropertyValues().add()` method: `if (proxyDefinition != null) { proxyDefinition.getPropertyValues().add(\"targetBeanName\", targetBeanName); ... }`",
