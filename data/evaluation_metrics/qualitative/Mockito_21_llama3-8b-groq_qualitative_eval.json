        "reasoning": "The review is mostly accurate. Bug 1 is correct - `InstantationException` isn't a standard Java exception. Bug 2 is technically correct about `newInstance()` being deprecated, though the code *already* uses `getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()`. Bug 3 and 4 correctly identify potential exceptions. Bug 5 is a minor point, but valid. Actionability is moderate; the review points out issues but doesn't offer specific fixes beyond suggesting a custom exception. Analytical depth is good, identifying potential runtime issues. Security awareness is low; the review doesn't consider security implications. The tone is constructive, focusing on potential problems and improvements. No guidelines were specified, so adherence is perfect."
