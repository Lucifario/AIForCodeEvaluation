Although checkNotNull is used, it does not prevent the constructor from being called with null values.\n   Suggested Fix: Add null checks for eventBus, event, subscriber, and subscriberMethod in the constructor. If any of these values are null, throw an IllegalArgumentException with a descriptive message.\n2. Explanation: The SubscriberExceptionContext class does not handle the case where the subscriberMethod is null.
