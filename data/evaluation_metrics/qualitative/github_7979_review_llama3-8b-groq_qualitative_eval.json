  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The Stopwatch class is not thread-safe, but it does not handle concurrent access correctly. If multiple threads call start() or stop() on the same stopwatch instance, it may lead to incorrect results or even a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Make the Stopwatch class thread-safe by synchronizing access to its internal state, or consider using a thread-safe alternative like AtomicLong.\n2. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not handle the case where the ticker.read() method returns a negative value. This could happen if the ticker is not properly synchronized or if there is a clock skew.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check in the elapsedNanos() method to handle negative values returned by ticker.read().\n3. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not handle the case where the elapsedNanos() method is called before the stopwatch is started. This could lead to an incorrect result.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check in the elapsedNanos() method to return 0 if the stopwatch is not started.\n4. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not handle the case where the elapsed() method is called with a TimeUnit that is not a power of 2. This could lead to an incorrect result.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check in the elapsed() method to ensure that the desired TimeUnit is a power of 2.\n5. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not handle the case where the elapsed() method is called with a TimeUnit that is not supported by the underlying ticker. This could lead to an incorrect result or an exception.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check in the elapsed() method to ensure that the desired TimeUnit is supported by the underlying ticker.",
