        "reasoning": "The review is factually accurate in identifying potential exceptions. It provides a good level of detail on where the issues might occur. However, it lacks actionable suggestions on how to fix these issues, which is why actionability is scored lower. The review shows a deep understanding of the potential root causes of the issues, hence the high score in analytical depth. Security awareness is not explicitly addressed, which is why it scores lower. The review is constructive and offers improvements rather than just criticism. The review adheres to the guidelines perfectly as it does not violate any constraints."

        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies potential exceptions in the constructor and `getConstraintTypeCounts` method. The descriptions are accurate and point to specific lines of code. The suggestions are actionable - adding null checks and validating input parameters would resolve the issues. The analytical depth is moderate; it identifies *what* could go wrong, but doesn't delve into the broader implications or suggest alternative designs. Security awareness is low, as these are primarily robustness issues, not security vulnerabilities. The review is constructive, focusing on potential problems and how to avoid them. It adheres to the implicit guideline of focusing on code quality and potential runtime errors."
