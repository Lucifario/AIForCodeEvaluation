  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: In the removeIf method, the condition for checking if removeFrom is a RandomAccess list is not sufficient. It should also check if removeFrom is a List.\n   Suggested Fix: if (removeFrom instanceof (List & RandomAccess))\n2. Explanation: In the removeIf method, the comment suggests using removeFrom.removeIf(predicate) for Java 8+ users when removeFrom is a Collection. However, this method is not available in older versions of Java.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for Java version and use the suggested method only for Java 8+\n3. Explanation: The removeIf method does not handle the case where the predicate is dependent on removeFrom. This could lead to unexpected behavior.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that the predicate is not dependent on removeFrom\n4. Explanation: The removeAll and retainAll methods do not handle the case where removeFrom is a Collection and elementsToRemove or elementsToRetain is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for null and throw a NullPointerException if null is passed\n5. Explanation: The contains method does not handle the case where iterable is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for null and throw a NullPointerException if null is passed",
