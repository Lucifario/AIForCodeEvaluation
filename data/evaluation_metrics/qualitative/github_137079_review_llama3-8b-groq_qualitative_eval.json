This is a typo error.\n   Suggested Fix: ByteVectorValues getByteVectorValues(String field) throws IOException {\n\treturn delegate.getByteVectorValues(field);\n}\n2. Explanation: The class 'ES814ScalarQuantizedVectorsFormat' does not handle the case where the 'confidenceInterval' is null. It should be checked for null before using it.\n   Suggested Fix: if (confidenceInterval == null) {\n\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"confidenceInterval cannot be null\");\n}\n3. Explanation: The class 'ES814ScalarQuantizedVectorsFormat' does not handle the case where the 'bits' is not one of the allowed values. It should be checked against the 'ALLOWED_BITS' mask.\n   Suggested Fix: if ((ALLOWED_BITS & (1 << bits)) == 0) {\n\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"bits must be one of: 4, 7, 8; bits=\" + bits);\n}",
