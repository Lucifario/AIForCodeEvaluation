It should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` in such cases.\n\n**Minor Improvement:**\nThe `RANDOM` field could be declared as `private static final Random RANDOM = new SecureRandom();` to use a cryptographically strong random number generator.\n\nHere's the JSON response with the bugs list:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bugs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"The `random` method with the signature `public static String random(int count, int start, int end, boolean letters, boolean numbers)` doesn't handle the case when `start` is greater than `end`.

It identifies a potential bug related to the `random` method and suggests using `SecureRandom` for better security. The review is constructive and adheres to the guidelines provided. The only minor point is that the actionability could be slightly improved by providing a code snippet for the `IllegalArgumentException` check, but the suggestions are clear and ready to implement."

        "reasoning": "The review identifies a valid potential bug regarding the `start` and `end` parameters in the `random` method. Failing to validate this could lead to unexpected behavior. The suggestion to use `SecureRandom` is also a good security practice, especially when generating random strings that might be used in security-sensitive contexts. Both points are actionable and well-explained. The analytical depth is moderate; it identifies *what* is wrong/could be improved but doesn't delve into *why* this particular method is chosen over others (e.g., why a standard `Random` was initially used). The review is constructive, offering improvements rather than just pointing out flaws. It also adheres to any implicit guidelines (no style complaints, focused on logic/security)."
