However, it lacks actionability, analytical depth, and security awareness as it does not provide any suggestions, root cause analysis, or security checks. It is not constructive as it only states the absence of bugs without offering any improvements. It adheres to the guidelines by not violating any constraints."

        "reasoning": "The review simply states there are no bugs. While technically not *incorrect*, it provides absolutely no feedback on the code. It doesn't assess the implementation, potential edge cases, or even basic code quality. It's a minimal response. The code itself appears straightforward, but a good review would at least confirm the CDF calculation is correct given the cited formula and consider potential issues with numerical stability or input validation. The lack of any actionable feedback or analysis results in very low scores for actionability and analytical depth. Constructiveness is moderate as it doesn't actively criticize, but it also doesn't help improve the code. Assuming no style constraints were given, adherence to guidelines is perfect."
