  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The code snippet does not handle potential IOExceptions when using StreamInput and StreamOutput. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.\n   Suggested Fix: Catch IOExceptions and handle them accordingly, e.g., by logging the error and continuing with the next operation.\n2. Explanation: The Builder class is not properly synchronized, which could lead to concurrency issues when multiple threads are accessing the enum values.\n   Suggested Fix: Synchronize the Builder class using a lock or a synchronized block to ensure thread safety.\n3. Explanation: The enum values do not have a proper toString method, which could lead to unexpected behavior when printing or logging enum values.\n   Suggested Fix: Override the toString method in the enum class to provide a meaningful string representation of each enum value.\n4. Explanation: The enum values do not have a proper equals method, which could lead to unexpected behavior when comparing enum values.\n   Suggested Fix: Override the equals method in the enum class to provide a proper comparison of enum values.",
