This can lead to a NullPointerException when trying to access the iterable.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check in the FluentIterable constructor and the from method to handle the case where the input iterable is null.\n2. Explanation: The FluentIterable class does not handle the case where the input iterable is not iterable. This can lead to a ClassCastException when trying to access the iterable.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check in the FluentIterable constructor and the from method to ensure that the input iterable is iterable.\n3. Explanation: The FluentIterable class does not handle the case where the input iterable is a Stream. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to access the iterable.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check in the FluentIterable constructor and the from method to ensure that the input iterable is not a Stream.\n4. Explanation: The FluentIterable class uses Optional.absent() to store the delegate iterable. However, this can lead to performance issues when trying to access the delegate iterable.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a different data structure to store the delegate iterable, such as a WeakReference or a soft reference.",
