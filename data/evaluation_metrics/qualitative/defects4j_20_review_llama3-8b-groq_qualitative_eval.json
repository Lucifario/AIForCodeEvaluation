  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The class DateTimeFormatterBuilder has a potential memory leak due to the caching of the last returned formatter. This can cause issues if the builder is reused and the cache is not cleared.\n   Suggested Fix: Clear the cache in the clear() method: iFormatter = null;\n2. Explanation: The canBuildFormatter(), canBuildPrinter(), and canBuildParser() methods do not check if the formatter is null before calling isFormatter(), isPrinter(), or isParser() on it. This can cause a NullPointerException if the formatter is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add null checks in the canBuildFormatter(), canBuildPrinter(), and canBuildParser() methods\n3. Explanation: The append(DateTimeFormatter formatter) method does not check if the formatter is null before calling getPrinter() and getParser() on it. This can cause a NullPointerException if the formatter is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check in the append(DateTimeFormatter formatter) method\n4. Explanation: The append(DateTimeFormatter formatter) method does not check if the formatter is of an invalid type before calling getPrinter() and getParser() on it. This can cause an IllegalArgumentException if the formatter is of an invalid type.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a type check in the append(DateTimeFormatter formatter) method\n5. Explanation: The checkPrinter(DateTimePrinter printer) method does not check if the printer is null before calling any methods on it. This can cause a NullPointerException if the printer is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check in the checkPrinter(DateTimePrinter printer) method",
