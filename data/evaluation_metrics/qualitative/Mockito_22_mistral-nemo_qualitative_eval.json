        "reasoning": "The review identifies several valid points. The null check issue in `areArrayElementsEqual()` is correct, as is the inconsistency in null handling between `areEqual()` and `areArraysEqual()`. The performance concern is reasonable, though not a critical bug. The `isArray()` point is a bit nuanced but technically correct. \n\nActionability is moderate; suggestions like using streams are given but not fleshed out with code. Analytical depth is good, identifying potential root causes. Security awareness is low; while the potential for exceptions exists, they aren't framed as security vulnerabilities. Constructiveness is high; the tone is helpful and focuses on improvements. The review doesn't mention any style concerns, so it adheres to any implicit 'ignore style' constraint."
