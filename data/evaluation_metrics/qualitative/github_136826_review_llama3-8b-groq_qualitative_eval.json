  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: In the constructor SetResetModeActionRequest(boolean enabled, Boolean deleteMetadata), the deleteMetadata parameter is not checked for null before being assigned to this.deleteMetadata. This might lead to a NullPointerException if deleteMetadata is null.\n   Suggested Fix: this.deleteMetadata = deleteMetadata != null && deleteMetadata;\n2. Explanation: The toXContent method does not handle the case when enabled is true. It only adds the deleteMetadata field when enabled is false. This might lead to incomplete data being written to the XContentBuilder.\n   Suggested Fix: builder.field(DELETE_METADATA.getPreferredName(), deleteMetadata);",
