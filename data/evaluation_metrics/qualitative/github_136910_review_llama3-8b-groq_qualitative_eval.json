  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: In the Builder class, the 'dimension' parameter is set to false by default, but it should be set to true to support time_series_dimension: false. This can cause issues with time series data.\n   Suggested Fix: this.dimension = Parameter.dimensionParam(m -> true);\n2. Explanation: The 'metric' parameter is set to POSITION by default, but it should be set to null or POSITION based on the index mode. This can cause issues with time series data.\n   Suggested Fix: this.metric = TimeSeriesParams.metricParam(m -> indexMode == IndexMode.TIME_SERIES ? null : TimeSeriesParams.MetricType.POSITION);\n3. Explanation: The 'hasDocValues' parameter is set to true by default, but it should be set to false if the 'dimension' parameter is true. This can cause issues with time series data.\n   Suggested Fix: this.hasDocValues = Parameter.docValuesParam(m -> dimension.getValue() == false);",
