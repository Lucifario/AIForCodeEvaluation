        "reasoning": "The review identifies several potential issues within the `CodeGenerator` class. Most of the points are factually correct and relate to missing calls or potential null pointer exceptions. The actionability is high, as the reviewer points to specific lines and describes what's missing or potentially problematic. The analytical depth is moderate; the review identifies *what* is wrong but doesn't always delve into *why* it's wrong beyond the immediate consequence (e.g., incorrect source mapping). Security awareness is low, as none of the identified issues are directly security-related. The review is constructive, focusing on improvements rather than just pointing out flaws. Finally, there were no constraints given, so adherence is perfect."
