Explanation: The method 'recoverFromStore' does not handle the case where the 'indexShard' is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'indexShard' before calling 'recoverFromStore'.\n2. Explanation: The method 'recoverFromLocalShards' does not handle the case where the 'shards' list is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'shards' before calling 'recoverFromLocalShards'.\n3. Explanation: The 'internalRecoverFromStore' method does not handle the case where the 'recoveryListener' is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'recoveryListener' before calling 'internalRecoverFromStore'.\n4. Explanation: The 'addIndices' method does not handle the case where the 'sources' array is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for 'sources' before calling 'addIndices'.",
