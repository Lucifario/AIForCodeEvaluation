  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The class is annotated with @Immutable, but it's not immutable. It has several static final fields that can be modified.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the @Immutable annotation or make the class truly immutable by using final fields and ensuring that no method can modify the state of the class.\n2. Explanation: The class has several static final fields that are not thread-safe. They can be accessed and modified concurrently by multiple threads.\n   Suggested Fix: Use thread-safe alternatives for these fields, such as using a ThreadLocal variable or a synchronized block to access and modify them.\n3. Explanation: The class has a method called stripAccents that uses a regular expression to remove accents from a string. However, this method is not thread-safe because it uses a static Pattern object that can be accessed and modified concurrently by multiple threads.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a thread-safe alternative for this method, such as using a synchronized block to access and modify the Pattern object.",
