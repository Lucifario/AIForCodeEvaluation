However, it does not explicitly address security risks, which is why the security awareness score is lower."

It points out *that* exceptions might be thrown, but doesn't demonstrate *how* or under what specific conditions. The suggested code fixes are simply defensive checks, which are good practice, but don't address the root cause of why the formatter might be null or unsupported. The review doesn't consider the design of the builder and how it's intended to be used. It also doesn't address any security concerns. The review is also focused on potential runtime exceptions rather than design flaws or potential logic errors. The review adheres to the requested format."
