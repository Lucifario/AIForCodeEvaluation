  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The `getVectorsFormat` method does not handle the case where the similarity is `MAX_INNER_PRODUCT` for the `INT8_HNSW` index type. It throws an exception but does not provide a clear error message.\n   Suggested Fix: Instead of throwing an exception, consider logging a warning or returning a default format. For example:\n```java\nif (similarity == DenseVectorFieldMapper.VectorSimilarity.MAX_INNER_PRODUCT) {\n    logger.warn(\"GPU vector indexing does not support [{}] similarity for [int8_hnsw] index type.\", similarity);\n    return new ES92GpuHnswVectorsFormat(int8HnswIndexOptions.m(), ES92GpuHnswVectorsFormat.DEFAULT_BEAM_WIDTH);\n}\n```\nThis will allow the application to continue running and provide a clear warning message.\n2. Explanation: The `getVectorsFormat` method does not handle the case where the index type is not supported. It throws an exception but does not provide a clear error message.\n   Suggested Fix: Instead of throwing an exception, consider logging a warning or returning a default format. For example:\n```java\nif (!vectorIndexTypeSupported(indexOptions.getType())) {\n    logger.warn(\"GPU vector indexing is not supported on this vector type: [{}]\", indexOptions.getType());\n    return new ES92GpuHnswVectorsFormat(ES92GpuHnswVectorsFormat.DEFAULT_BEAM_WIDTH);\n}\n```\nThis will allow the application to continue running and provide a clear warning message.\n3. Explanation: The `getVectorsFormat` method does not handle the case where the `efConstruction` value is not set. It uses a default value but does not provide a clear error message.\n   Suggested Fix: Instead of using a default value, consider throwing an exception or logging a warning. For example:\n```java\nif (efConstruction == HnswGraphBuilder.DEFAULT_BEAM_WIDTH) {\n    logger.warn(\"efConstruction value is not set. Using default value.\");\n    efConstruction = ES92GpuHnswVectorsFormat.DEFAULT_BEAM_WIDTH;\n}\n```\nThis will provide a clear warning message and allow the application to continue running.",
