        "reasoning": "The review is technically accurate and provides clear, actionable suggestions. It identifies potential issues with the code, such as the risk of indefinite loops and missing checks for `absoluteAccuracy`. The review also suggests making the class final and non-instantiable, which is a good practice for utility classes. However, it does not explicitly address security risks, which is why the security awareness score is lower. The review is constructive and adheres to guidelines, providing specific lines and severity levels for the issues."

        "reasoning": "The review identifies valid issues. The first point about `Integer.MAX_VALUE` is a good catch, as it highlights a potential for very long execution. The second point regarding the `absoluteAccuracy` check is also correct; the code should validate solver support. The third point about the utility class is a valid style suggestion. The actionability is high because the issues are clearly described and relatively easy to address. Analytical depth is moderate; the review identifies *what* is wrong but doesn't delve deeply into *why* these are problematic beyond the immediate consequences. Security awareness is low, as none of the issues relate to security vulnerabilities. The review is constructive, offering improvements rather than just pointing out flaws. It adheres to the provided constraints."
