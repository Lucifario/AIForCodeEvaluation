The suggestions are concrete and actionable, but lack root cause analysis. Security risks are not addressed. The review is mostly constructive but could be more positive and helpful. The review adheres to the given constraints."

It's impossible to assess the factual correctness, actionability, or analytical depth without the actual code. The review doesn't address security concerns, and is purely negative, offering no constructive suggestions. However, the review *does* adhere to the requested JSON format, so it scores highly on that constraint."
