  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The KeywordFieldMapper class has a potential null pointer exception in the constructor when the 'term' parameter is null.\n   Suggested Fix: KeywordField(String field, BytesRef term, FieldType ft) { if (term == null) { term = BytesRef.EMPTY_BYTES; } super(field, term, ft); }\n2. Explanation: The Builder class has a potential issue with the 'eagerGlobalOrdinals' parameter being a boolean, but it should be a boolean that can be set to true or false, not a boolean that can be set to any value.\n   Suggested Fix: private final Parameter<Boolean> eagerGlobalOrdinals = Parameter.boolParam(\"eager_global_ordinals\", false, m -> toType(m).eagerGlobalOrdinals, false);\n3. Explanation: The textSearchInfo method has a potential issue with the 'similarity' parameter being nullable, but it should not be nullable.\n   Suggested Fix: private static TextSearchInfo textSearchInfo(FieldType fieldType, SimilarityProvider similarity, NamedAnalyzer searchAnalyzer, NamedAnalyzer searchQuoteAnalyzer) { if (similarity == null) { similarity = SimilarityProvider.DEFAULT; } final TextSearchInfo textSearchInfo = new TextSearchInfo(fieldType, similarity, searchAnalyzer, searchQuoteAnalyzer);",
