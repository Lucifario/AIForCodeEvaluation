However, the review lacks analytical depth; it simply flags the numbers without explaining *why* these specific numbers are problematic in this context (e.g., what do they represent? Are they related to a specific algorithm? Are they empirically derived constants?). There's no security consideration in the review. While the review isn't negative, it's also not particularly helpful beyond the basic identification of magic numbers. It doesn't suggest *what* the constants should be named, only that they *should* be named. The review adheres to any implicit guidelines (no style issues were flagged, and the focus is solely on the identified issue)."
