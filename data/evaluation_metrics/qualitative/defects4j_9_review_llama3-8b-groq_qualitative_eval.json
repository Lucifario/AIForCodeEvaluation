  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The `reset` method does not handle the case where `p1` and `p2` are the same point, but `p2` is a scalar multiple of `p1`. This can lead to a division by zero error when calculating `norm2`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that `p1` and `p2` are not scalar multiples of each other before calculating `norm2`.\n2. Explanation: The `isSimilarTo` method uses a tolerance of `1.0e-10` to check if two lines are similar. However, this tolerance may not be sufficient for all use cases, and may lead to incorrect results if the lines are very close to being perpendicular.\n   Suggested Fix: Increase the tolerance value to a more robust value, such as `1.0e-6` or `1.0e-9`.\n3. Explanation: The `distance` method uses a tolerance of `1.0e-10` to check if a point is contained in the line. However, this tolerance may not be sufficient for all use cases, and may lead to incorrect results if the point is very close to the line but not exactly on it.\n   Suggested Fix: Increase the tolerance value to a more robust value, such as `1.0e-6` or `1.0e-9`.\n4. Explanation: The `closestPoint` method assumes that the lines are not parallel. However, if the lines are parallel, the method will return an incorrect result. To fix this, add a check to ensure that the lines are not parallel before calculating the closest point.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that the lines are not parallel before calculating the closest point. If the lines are parallel, return the point on the line that is closest to the other line.",
