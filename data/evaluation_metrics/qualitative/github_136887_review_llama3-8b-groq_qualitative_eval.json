  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The constructor FieldCapabilitiesResponse(String[] indices, Map<String, Map<String, FieldCapabilities>> fields, List<FieldCapabilitiesIndexResponse> indexResponses, List<FieldCapabilitiesFailure> failures) has a redundant parameter. The parameter 'failures' is already included in the other constructor FieldCapabilitiesResponse(String[] indices, Map<String, Map<String, FieldCapabilities>> fields, List<FieldCapabilitiesIndexResponse> indexResponses, List<FieldCapabilitiesFailure> failures).\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the redundant constructor FieldCapabilitiesResponse(String[] indices, Map<String, Map<String, FieldCapabilities>> fields, List<FieldCapabilitiesIndexResponse> indexResponses, List<FieldCapabilitiesFailure> failures).\n2. Explanation: The method getFailedIndicesCount() has a potential null pointer exception. The field 'failures' is not checked for null before iterating over it.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the field 'failures' before iterating over it in the method getFailedIndicesCount().\n3. Explanation: The method toXContentChunked(ToXContent.Params params) has a potential exception. If the indexResponses size is greater than 0, it throws an IllegalStateException. However, it does not handle the case when the indexResponses size is 0.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the indexResponses before calling the size() method in the method toXContentChunked(ToXContent.Params params).",
