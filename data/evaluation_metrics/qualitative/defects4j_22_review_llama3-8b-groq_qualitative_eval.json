  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method getFraction(int whole, int numerator, int denominator) does not handle the case when the denominator is zero correctly. It throws an ArithmeticException if the denominator is zero, but it does not check if the numerator is zero in this case. This can lead to a division by zero error.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for numerator being zero when denominator is zero and throw an ArithmeticException in this case.\n2. Explanation: The method getFraction(int numerator, int denominator) does not handle the case when the numerator is Integer.MIN_VALUE and the denominator is negative correctly. It throws an ArithmeticException in this case, but it does not handle the case when the numerator is Integer.MIN_VALUE and the denominator is positive correctly.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for numerator being Integer.MIN_VALUE and denominator being negative, and throw an ArithmeticException in this case.\n3. Explanation: The method getFraction(int whole, int numerator, int denominator) does not handle the case when the numerator exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE correctly. It throws an ArithmeticException in this case, but it does not handle the case when the numerator is negative and the whole number part is negative correctly.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for numerator being negative and whole number part being negative, and throw an ArithmeticException in this case.\n4. Explanation: The class Fraction does not handle the case when the denominator is zero correctly. It throws an ArithmeticException in this case, but it does not handle the case when the numerator is zero correctly.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for numerator being zero when denominator is zero and throw an ArithmeticException in this case.",
