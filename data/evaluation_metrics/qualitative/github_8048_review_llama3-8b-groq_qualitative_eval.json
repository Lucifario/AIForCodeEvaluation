  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The Stopwatch class is not thread-safe, which can lead to inaccurate measurements and unexpected behavior in multi-threaded environments.\n   Suggested Fix: Use synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or atomic variables, to ensure thread safety in the Stopwatch class.\n2. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not handle potential null pointer exceptions when the Ticker object is null.\n   Suggested Fix: Add null checks for the Ticker object in the Stopwatch constructor and methods that use it.\n3. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not handle potential arithmetic overflows when calculating elapsed time.\n   Suggested Fix: Use long arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and ensure accurate calculations.\n4. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not provide a way to reset the elapsed time to zero without stopping the stopwatch.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a method to reset the elapsed time to zero without stopping the stopwatch.\n5. Explanation: The Stopwatch class does not handle potential exceptions when creating a new stopwatch with a custom Ticker object.\n   Suggested Fix: Add exception handling to the Stopwatch constructor and methods that use a custom Ticker object.",
