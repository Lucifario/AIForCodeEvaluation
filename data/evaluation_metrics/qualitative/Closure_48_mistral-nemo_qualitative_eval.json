        "reasoning": "The review identifies potential code quality issues (readability, maintainability) but is extremely generic and lacks context. While the points about long names, magic numbers, and complex structures are valid *in general*, they are presented as blanket statements without specific examples from the provided code snippet. The review doesn't demonstrate understanding of *why* these things might be acceptable in this specific context (e.g., the static imports are likely for performance or clarity within the class). The suggestions are vague ('use instance variables', 'use switch statements') and not ready to be copy-pasted. There's no analysis of the code's purpose or potential impact of changes. Security is completely ignored. The review isn't particularly negative, but it's not very helpful because it's so high-level and doesn't engage with the actual code. It does adhere to the guidelines by providing locations (line numbers), but these are broad ranges."
