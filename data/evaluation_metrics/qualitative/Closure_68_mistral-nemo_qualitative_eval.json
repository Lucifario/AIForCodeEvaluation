However, it lacks actionable suggestions on how to fix these issues, providing only descriptions of the problems. The review does not delve deeply into the root causes of these issues, nor does it address any security concerns. The review is constructive in identifying issues but does not offer solutions. It adheres to the guidelines by focusing on the specified constraints."
