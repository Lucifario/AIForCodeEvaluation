However, it lacks specific details on how to handle potential exceptions or security risks, such as invalid input or integer overflow. The review is constructive and adheres to the guidelines provided."

        "reasoning": "The review presents a straightforward and correct implementation. The code directly leverages `StringUtils.isEmpty` and `Integer.parseInt`, which are standard and appropriate. The use of a default value provides a safe fallback. The analytical depth is moderate; it doesn't explore potential NumberFormatExceptions beyond the isEmpty check, but that's acceptable for this level of code. Security awareness is present because `Integer.parseInt` could throw a NumberFormatException if the string isn't a valid integer, but the code handles the empty string case. Constructiveness is high as it's a simple, effective solution. It adheres to any implicit guidelines of conciseness and clarity."
