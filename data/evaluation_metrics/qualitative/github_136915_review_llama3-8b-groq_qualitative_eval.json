This method is likely a utility function that should be implemented or imported.\n   Suggested Fix: Implement the 'freezeAndDeduplicateFieldType' method or import it from a utility class.\n2. Explanation: The 'eagerGlobalOrdinals' parameter is not validated for null values. This could lead to a NullPointerException when the parameter is not provided.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the 'eagerGlobalOrdinals' parameter and provide a default value if it's null.",
