  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: Potential null pointer exception when calling jackson2JsonDecoder() or jackson2JsonEncoder() methods. These methods are deprecated and will be removed in future versions.\n   Suggested Fix: Use jacksonJsonDecoder() or jacksonJsonEncoder() methods instead.\n2. Explanation: The protobufDecoder() and protobufEncoder() methods do not check for null decoder or encoder instances. This could lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add null checks for decoder and encoder instances before calling these methods.\n3. Explanation: The maxInMemorySize() method is not implemented in this interface. This could lead to unexpected behavior when using the jacksonSmileDecoder() or jacksonSmileEncoder() methods.\n   Suggested Fix: Implement the maxInMemorySize() method to provide a default value or throw an exception when this method is called.",
