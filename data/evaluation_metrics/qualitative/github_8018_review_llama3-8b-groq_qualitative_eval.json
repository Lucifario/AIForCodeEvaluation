  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method mightContain() does not handle null inputs correctly. It calls the mightContain() method of the strategy object, which may also not handle null inputs correctly. This could lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling the mightContain() method of the strategy object.\n2. Explanation: The method put() does not handle null inputs correctly. It calls the put() method of the strategy object, which may also not handle null inputs correctly. This could lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling the put() method of the strategy object.\n3. Explanation: The BloomFilter class does not handle the case where the strategy object is null. This could lead to a NullPointerException when the put() or mightContain() method is called.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the strategy object in the constructor and throw an exception if it is null.\n4. Explanation: The BloomFilter class does not handle the case where the funnel object is null. This could lead to a NullPointerException when the put() or mightContain() method is called.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the funnel object in the constructor and throw an exception if it is null.\n5. Explanation: The BloomFilter class does not handle the case where the bits object is null. This could lead to a NullPointerException when the put() or mightContain() method is called.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the bits object in the constructor and throw an exception if it is null.\n6. Explanation: The BloomFilter class does not handle the case where the numHashFunctions is less than or equal to 0. This could lead to an IllegalArgumentException when the constructor is called.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that numHashFunctions is greater than 0 in the constructor.\n7. Explanation: The BloomFilter class does not handle the case where the numHashFunctions is greater than 255. This could lead to an IllegalArgumentException when the constructor is called.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that numHashFunctions is less than or equal to 255 in the constructor.",
