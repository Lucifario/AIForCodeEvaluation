        "reasoning": "The review identifies several potential issues, mostly related to missing imports and incorrect handling of null or invalid input strings in the `toInt` and `toLong` methods. The points about returning default values for null or invalid inputs are valid and important for robustness. The import suggestions are also correct. The analytical depth is moderate; it identifies *what* is wrong but doesn't delve into *why* these issues might exist (e.g., lack of input validation). Security awareness is low, as the review doesn't mention any security implications. The review is constructive, focusing on how to improve the code rather than just pointing out flaws. It follows the constraints by providing specific line numbers and descriptions. The review is very actionable, as the suggested fixes are straightforward."
