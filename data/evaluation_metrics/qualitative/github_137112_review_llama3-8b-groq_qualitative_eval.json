Explanation: The class Unresolvable extends Resolvable without checking if Resolvable is null, which can lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: public interface Unresolvable extends Resolvable { ... }\n2. Explanation: The method unresolvedMessage() does not have a default implementation, but it is declared in an interface. This can lead to a compilation error if the interface is extended by another interface.\n   Suggested Fix: public interface Unresolvable extends Resolvable { public default String unresolvedMessage() { return \"Unresolved message\"; } }\n3. Explanation: The constant UNRESOLVED_PREFIX is declared as a static field, but it is not marked as static. This can lead to a compilation error if the interface is extended by another interface.\n   Suggested Fix: public static final String UNRESOLVED_PREFIX = \"?\";",
