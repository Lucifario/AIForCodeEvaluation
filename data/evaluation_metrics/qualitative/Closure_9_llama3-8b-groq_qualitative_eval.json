        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies potential `NullPointerException`s and `URISyntaxException`s. The locations are accurate, assuming the code snippet provided is representative of lines 123, 128, 131, 136, and 141 in the `ProcessCommonJSModules` class. The suggestions are actionable - a developer could easily add null checks and try-catch blocks. However, the analysis doesn't go beyond identifying the exceptions; it doesn't suggest *why* these variables might be null in the context of the code's logic. Security awareness is low, as the identified issues are primarily about code robustness, not security vulnerabilities. Constructiveness is moderate; it points out problems but doesn't offer solutions beyond the implicit need for error handling. The review adheres to any implicit guidelines (no style comments were given)."
