  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The checkArgument function is not sufficient to handle the case where x > MAX_SIGNED_POWER_OF_TWO. This is because the checkArgument function only checks if the argument is within a certain range, but it does not check if the argument is representable as a long.\n   Suggested Fix: Replace the checkArgument function with a check that also checks if x is representable as a long.\n2. Explanation: The lessThanBranchFree function does not handle the case where x and y are both negative. This is because the function assumes that x and y are both positive.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to handle the case where x and y are both negative.\n3. Explanation: The log2 function does not handle the case where x is a power of two and mode is UNNECESSARY. This is because the function does not check if x is a power of two before calling checkRoundingUnnecessary.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to handle the case where x is a power of two and mode is UNNECESSARY.\n4. Explanation: The log10 function does not handle the case where x is a power of ten and mode is UNNECESSARY. This is because the function does not check if x is a power of ten before calling checkRoundingUnnecessary.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to handle the case where x is a power of ten and mode is UNNECESSARY.",
