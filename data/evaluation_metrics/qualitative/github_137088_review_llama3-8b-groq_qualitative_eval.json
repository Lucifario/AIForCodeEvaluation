  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The FieldCapabilitiesResponse class has multiple constructors with different parameters. This can lead to confusion and bugs when creating instances of the class. Consider removing the constructors with fewer parameters and using the constructor with the most parameters instead.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the constructors with fewer parameters and use the constructor with the most parameters instead.\npublic FieldCapabilitiesResponse(String[] indices, Map<String, Map<String, FieldCapabilities>> fields, List<FieldCapabilitiesIndexResponse> indexResponses, List<FieldCapabilitiesFailure> failures) {\n    this.fields = Objects.requireNonNull(fields);\n    this.indexResponses = Objects.requireNonNull(indexResponses);\n    this.indices = indices;\n    this.failures = failures;\n}\n2. Explanation: The FieldCapabilitiesResponse class has a method getFailedIndicesCount() that iterates over the failures list to count the number of failed indices. This can be optimized by using a single loop to count the total number of failed indices.\n   Suggested Fix: Optimize the getFailedIndicesCount() method to use a single loop to count the total number of failed indices.\npublic int getFailedIndicesCount() {\n    int count = 0;\n    for (FieldCapabilitiesFailure fieldCapabilitiesFailure : this.failures) {\n        count += fieldCapabilitiesFailure.getIndices().length;\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n3. Explanation: The FieldCapabilitiesResponse class has a method toXContentChunked() that throws an IllegalStateException if the indexResponses list is not empty. However, this method is not used in the provided code snippet. Consider removing this method or using it correctly.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the toXContentChunked() method or use it correctly.\n@Override\npublic Iterator<? extends ToXContent> toXContentChunked(ToXContent.Params params) {\n    // ...",
