Explanation: The method maxEncodedSize(int) is not implemented in the BaseEncoding class, which may cause a NullPointerException when used.\n   Suggested Fix: public int maxEncodedSize(int len) { return (int) Math.ceil((double) len * getCharBytes()); }\n2. Explanation: The method maxDecodedSize(int) is not implemented in the BaseEncoding class, which may cause a NullPointerException when used.\n   Suggested Fix: public int maxDecodedSize(int len) { return (int) Math.ceil((double) len / getCharBytes()); }\n3. Explanation: The method getCharBytes() is not implemented in the BaseEncoding class, which may cause a NullPointerException when used.\n   Suggested Fix: public abstract int getCharBytes();\n4. Explanation: The method trimTrailingPadding(CharSequence) is not implemented in the BaseEncoding class, which may cause a NullPointerException when used.\n   Suggested Fix: public abstract CharSequence trimTrailingPadding(CharSequence chars);\n5. Explanation: The method decodeTo(byte[], CharSequence) is not implemented in the BaseEncoding class, which may cause a NullPointerException when used.\n   Suggested Fix: public abstract int decodeTo(byte[] tmp, CharSequence chars);\n6. Explanation: The method encodingStream(Writer) and decodingStream(Reader) are not implemented in the BaseEncoding class, which may cause a NullPointerException when used.\n   Suggested Fix: public abstract OutputStream encodingStream(Writer writer); public abstract InputStream decodingStream(Reader reader);",
