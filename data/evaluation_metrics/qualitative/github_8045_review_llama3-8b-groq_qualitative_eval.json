  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The edgeCount() method does not handle the case when the graph has no nodes. This will result in an exception when trying to access the nodes() method.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check at the beginning of the edgeCount() method to return 0 when the graph has no nodes.\n2. Explanation: The incidentEdges() method does not handle the case when the node is not in the graph. This will result in an exception when trying to access the nodes() method.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check at the beginning of the incidentEdges() method to return an empty set when the node is not in the graph.\n3. Explanation: The degree() method does not handle the case when the graph has no nodes. This will result in an exception when trying to access the nodes() method.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check at the beginning of the degree() method to return 0 when the graph has no nodes.\n4. Explanation: The inDegree() and outDegree() methods do not handle the case when the node is not in the graph. This will result in an exception when trying to access the nodes() method.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check at the beginning of the inDegree() and outDegree() methods to return 0 when the node is not in the graph.\n5. Explanation: The hasEdgeConnecting() method does not handle the case when either of the nodes is not in the graph. This will result in an exception when trying to access the nodes() method.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check at the beginning of the hasEdgeConnecting() method to return false when either of the nodes is not in the graph.\n6. Explanation: The nodeInvalidatableSet() and nodePairInvalidatableSet() methods do not handle the case when the node is not in the graph. This will result in an exception when trying to access the nodes() method.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check at the beginning of the nodeInvalidatableSet() and nodePairInvalidatableSet() methods to return an empty set when the node is not in the graph.",
