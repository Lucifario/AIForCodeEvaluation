  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the parser fails to understand multiple round brackets in an EXPLAIN command.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to handle this case, for example by throwing a ParsingException with a specific message.\n2. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the query depth exceeds the maximum allowed depth.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to prevent the query depth from exceeding the maximum allowed depth, for example by throwing a ParsingException with a specific message.\n3. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the parsing errors are not combined correctly.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a more robust way to combine parsing exceptions, for example by using a try-catch block to catch and combine exceptions.\n4. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the logical plan is not an instance of Explain.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that the logical plan is an instance of Explain before throwing a ParsingException.",
