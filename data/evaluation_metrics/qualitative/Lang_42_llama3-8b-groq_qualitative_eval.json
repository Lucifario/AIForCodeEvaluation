        "reasoning": "The review raises several valid points about code style and maintainability, but many are debatable and lack strong justification. \n\n* **Factual Correctness:** Some suggestions are reasonable (naming convention, `@since` tag), but others are more opinionated (interface vs. final class, static factory methods). The claim about `ISO8859_1_ARRAY` being bad practice isn't inherently wrong, but a strong argument for *why* a static method is better is missing.  The suggestion to split into separate utility classes is also a matter of preference and context.\n* **Actionability:** The suggestions are mostly high-level.  For example, saying \"use a static factory method\" doesn't provide any code examples or explain *how* to implement it in this specific case.  It's not ready-to-copy code.\n* **Analytical Depth:** The review identifies potential issues with maintainability and testability, but doesn't delve into the root causes or offer specific trade-offs. It's mostly surface-level observation.\n* **Security Awareness:** There's no mention of security concerns, which is appropriate for this code, but also means it doesn't demonstrate security awareness.\n* **Constructiveness:** The review is mostly critical and doesn't offer positive feedback or acknowledge any good aspects of the code. It feels like a list of things that *should* be done differently, rather than a collaborative effort to improve the code.\n* **Adherence to Guidelines:** The review itself doesn't violate any guidelines. It provides a list of issues with severity levels."
