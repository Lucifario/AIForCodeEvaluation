  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method `getVectorsFormatProvider()` returns a lambda function that does not handle the case where `indexOptions.getType()` is null. This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for `indexOptions.getType()` before calling `vectorIndexTypeSupported()` method.\n2. Explanation: The method `getVectorsFormat()` does not handle the case where `indexOptions` is null. This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for `indexOptions` before calling `getType()` method.\n3. Explanation: The method `getVectorsFormat()` does not handle the case where `similarity` is null. This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for `similarity` before calling `equals()` method.\n4. Explanation: The method `getVectorsFormat()` does not handle the case where `hnswIndexOptions` or `int8HnswIndexOptions` is null. This can lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add null checks for `hnswIndexOptions` and `int8HnswIndexOptions` before calling `efConstruction()` method.\n5. Explanation: The method `getVectorsFormat()` does not handle the case where `efConstruction` is less than 0. This can lead to an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for `efConstruction` being less than 0 before returning the `ES92GpuHnswVectorsFormat` or `ES92GpuHnswSQVectorsFormat` object.",
