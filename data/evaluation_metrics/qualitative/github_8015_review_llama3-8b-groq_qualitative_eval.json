It should return an empty map instead of throwing a ClassCastException.\n   Suggested Fix: if (!(map instanceof ImmutableEnumMap)) { return ImmutableMap.of(); }\n2. Explanation: The method toImmutableEnumMap does not handle the case where the mapped keys contain duplicates correctly. It should throw an IllegalArgumentException instead of an IllegalStateException.\n   Suggested Fix: if (map.containsKey(key)) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Duplicate key found\"); }",
