While it doesn't explicitly address security concerns, it is not directly relevant in this context. The review is constructive and adheres to the given constraints."

        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies missing error handling for all the defined `DiagnosticType`s within the `process` method. The descriptions are clear and point directly to the missing checks. The actionability is high because each bug is a specific missing check that can be implemented. The analytical depth is moderate; it identifies *what* is missing but doesn't delve into *why* these checks might be failing or potential edge cases. Security awareness is low, as the code's security implications aren't addressed. The review is constructive, focusing on missing functionality rather than stylistic issues. Finally, there were no constraints given, so adherence is perfect."
