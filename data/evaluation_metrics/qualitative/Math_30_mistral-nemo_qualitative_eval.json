        "reasoning": "The review identifies a large number of potential issues, and most of them are likely correct given the limited code provided. The reviewer correctly points out missing null checks, empty array checks, and the need for input validation. However, the review is extremely repetitive, listing the same concerns for multiple methods (e.g., NaN handling, negative values) without providing specific guidance on *how* to address them in each context. It's a laundry list of 'what could be wrong' rather than a focused analysis. The actionability is low because the 'code' field simply points to the method signature; it doesn't suggest fixes. Analytical depth is also low; it identifies potential problems but doesn't explain *why* these are critical issues for the Mann-Whitney U test. Security awareness is minimal; while input validation is important, the review doesn't highlight any specific security vulnerabilities. Constructiveness is low due to the purely negative nature of the feedback. The review adheres to the guidelines in that it focuses on the code provided and doesn't introduce external concerns."
