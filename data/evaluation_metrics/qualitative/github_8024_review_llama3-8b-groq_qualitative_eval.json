  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method 'subgraphHasCycle' does not handle the case where the graph has a self-loop.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check for self-loops before starting the traversal.\n2. Explanation: The method 'transitiveClosure' does not handle the case where the graph has a large number of nodes or edges, leading to performance issues.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a more efficient algorithm for computing the transitive closure, such as Floyd-Warshall or Johnson's algorithm.\n3. Explanation: The method 'canTraverseWithoutReusingEdge' does not handle the case where the graph has a large number of parallel edges, leading to performance issues.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a more efficient data structure to store and query parallel edges.",
