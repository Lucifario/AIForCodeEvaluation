  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The CalendarUtils class has a static field INSTANCE which is initialized with the result of getInstance() method. This can lead to a NullPointerException if getInstance() method returns null.\n   Suggested Fix: Initialize INSTANCE with a default CalendarUtils object instead of getInstance() method.\n2. Explanation: The getInstance() method does not handle the case when the locale is null, which can lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the locale parameter in the getInstance() method and throw an IllegalArgumentException if it's null.\n3. Explanation: The getMonthDisplayNames() method does not handle the case when the displayNames map is null, which can lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the displayNames map in the getMonthDisplayNames() method and return an empty array if it's null.",
