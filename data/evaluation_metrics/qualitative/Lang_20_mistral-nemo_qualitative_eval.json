        "reasoning": "The review covers fundamental String utility methods (isEmpty, isBlank, isNotEmpty, isNotBlank) and the implementations are correct and concise. The use of `str == null` checks before accessing `str.length()` or calling `str.trim()` prevents `NullPointerException`s, demonstrating good security awareness. The methods are well-named and follow a clear, consistent pattern. The analytical depth is moderate; while the code is correct, a deeper analysis might consider potential performance implications of `trim()` in `isBlank()` for very large strings, but this is a minor point. The review is constructive, offering straightforward and correct implementations. It adheres to the implicit guideline of focusing on correctness and safety."
