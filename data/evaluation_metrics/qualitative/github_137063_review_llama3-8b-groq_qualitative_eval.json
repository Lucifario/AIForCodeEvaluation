  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method `getMetric()` is called without checking if the `metric` parameter is null. This can lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling `getMetric()`: `if (metric != null) { ... }`\n2. Explanation: The `scalingFactor` parameter is not validated to be a finite number. This can lead to unexpected behavior when scaling values.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a validation check to ensure the `scalingFactor` is a finite number: `if (Double.isFinite(v) == false || v <= 0) { ... }`\n3. Explanation: The `nullValue` parameter is not validated to be a valid double value. This can lead to unexpected behavior when setting the null value.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a validation check to ensure the `nullValue` is a valid double value: `if (v == null) { ... }`",
