        "reasoning": "The review simply states there are no bugs. While technically not *incorrect* (assuming a thorough manual review hasn't revealed any), it provides absolutely no feedback on the code. It's not actionable, doesn't demonstrate any analytical depth, and doesn't address security concerns (which aren't obviously present, but should be considered). It's not particularly constructive either, as it offers no suggestions for improvement. It does adhere to the guideline of not identifying bugs when none are found, but that's a very low bar. A good review would at least confirm the code's adherence to the stated conventions and best practices."
