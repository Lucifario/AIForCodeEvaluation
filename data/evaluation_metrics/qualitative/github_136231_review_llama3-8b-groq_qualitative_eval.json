  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The default implementation of the resolved() method always returns false, which may not be the intended behavior. This could lead to unexpected results in the calling code.\n   Suggested Fix: default boolean resolved() { return false; } should be overridden to provide a meaningful implementation.\n2. Explanation: The UNRESOLVED_PREFIX constant is not used anywhere in the code. It's likely a leftover from a previous implementation and can be removed to declutter the code.\n   Suggested Fix: Remove the UNRESOLVED_PREFIX constant.\n3. Explanation: The unresolvedMessage() method is not checked for null or empty string. This could lead to a NullPointerException or unexpected behavior if the method returns null or an empty string.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check for the unresolvedMessage() method and return a default message if it's null or empty.",
