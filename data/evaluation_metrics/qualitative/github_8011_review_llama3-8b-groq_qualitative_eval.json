  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: Potential null pointer exception in the 'startAsync()' method. The 'services' list is not checked for null before calling 'startAsync()'.\n   Suggested Fix: checkNotNull(services, \"services cannot be null\");\n2. Explanation: Potential memory leak due to the 'LazyLogger' class. The 'logger' field is a static field and is not properly cleaned up when the 'ServiceManager' instance is garbage collected.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a WeakReference to the logger instance to prevent memory leaks.\n3. Explanation: Potential security issue due to the use of 'System.exit(1)' in the 'Server' class. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a more secure way to handle service failures, such as logging the error and continuing execution.",
