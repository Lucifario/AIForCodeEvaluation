        "reasoning": "The review is mostly accurate. The points about the constructor being public and the `toInt` and `toLong` methods not handling negative numbers correctly are valid concerns. The suggestion about combining constants is a good one for maintainability. However, the security awareness is low as the review doesn't mention any security implications. The analytical depth is moderate; it identifies *what* is wrong but doesn't delve deeply into *why* these issues exist in the first place (e.g., design choices). The suggestions are actionable, and the tone is constructive. The review doesn't appear to have any constraints, so adherence is perfect."
