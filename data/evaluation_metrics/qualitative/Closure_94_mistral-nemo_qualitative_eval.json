        "reasoning": "The review indicates no bugs were found. Given the code snippet provided, this is a reasonable assessment. The code appears to be a utility class with well-defined methods. The analytical depth is moderate; while the code is correct, a deeper analysis might consider potential edge cases or performance implications of the boolean conversion logic. Security awareness is low, as the review doesn't mention any potential security vulnerabilities (though this code doesn't immediately scream vulnerabilities). The review is constructive as it doesn't offer criticism, simply stating the absence of bugs. It perfectly adheres to any implicit guidelines (e.g., not adding style suggestions). Actionability is high because the lack of bugs means no changes are needed. Factual correctness is high because the code appears to be valid and the review accurately reflects that."
