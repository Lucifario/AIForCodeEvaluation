  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The isSameDay method does not correctly handle dates in different time zones. It assumes that dates in different time zones are not the same day.\n   Suggested Fix: Use the Calendar.getInstance() method with a specific time zone to get the correct date in that time zone.\n2. Explanation: The isSameInstant method does not correctly handle dates in different time zones. It assumes that dates in different time zones are the same instant in time.\n   Suggested Fix: Use the Calendar.getInstance() method with a specific time zone to get the correct date in that time zone and then compare the time in milliseconds.\n3. Explanation: The DateUtils class does not handle null dates correctly. It throws an IllegalArgumentException when a null date is passed to a method.\n   Suggested Fix: Add null checks at the beginning of each method to handle null dates and return a meaningful result or throw a more specific exception.\n4. Explanation: The DateUtils class does not handle dates with different time zones correctly. It assumes that dates in different time zones are the same day or instant in time.\n   Suggested Fix: Use the Calendar.getInstance() method with a specific time zone to get the correct date in that time zone and then compare the dates or times.",
