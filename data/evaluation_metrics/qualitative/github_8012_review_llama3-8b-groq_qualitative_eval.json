This can lead to a NullPointerException when calling rangeContaining(null).\n   Suggested Fix: public abstract @Nullable Range<C> rangeContaining(@Nullable C value) { if (value == null) { return null; } return rangeContaining(value); }\n2. Explanation: The AbstractRangeSet class does not handle the case where the input range is null when calling add(null) or remove(null). This can lead to a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: public void add(@Nullable Range<C> range) { if (range == null) { throw new NullPointerException(\"Range cannot be null\"); } throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }\n3. Explanation: The AbstractRangeSet class does not handle the case where the input range is null when calling removeAll(null).

Explanation: The AbstractRangeSet class does not handle the case where the input range is null when calling removeAll(null).
