Explanation: The constructor CentroidAssignments(float[][] centroids, int[] assignments, int[] overspillAssignments) does not check if the centroids array is empty before accessing its length. This could lead to a NullPointerException if the centroids array is null.\n   Suggested Fix: this(numCentroids, centroids == null ? new float[0][] : centroids, assignments, overspillAssignments);\n2. Explanation: The constructor CentroidAssignments(float[][] centroids, int[] assignments, int[] overspillAssignments) does not check if the centroids array is null before accessing its elements. This could lead to a NullPointerException if the centroids array is null.\n   Suggested Fix: if (centroids != null && centroids.length > 0) { ... }\n3. Explanation: The constructor CentroidAssignments(float[][] centroids, int[] assignments, int[] overspillAssignments) does not check if the assignments array and overspillAssignments array have the same length before asserting it. This could lead to a ClassCastException if the arrays have different lengths.\n   Suggested Fix: if (assignments != null && overspillAssignments != null && assignments.length == overspillAssignments.length) { ... }",
