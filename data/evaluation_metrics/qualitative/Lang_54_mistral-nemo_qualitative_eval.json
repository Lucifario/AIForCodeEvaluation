        "reasoning": "The review is factually correct and provides clear, actionable suggestions. It identifies specific issues with the code, such as missing implementations and unnecessary public constructors. The review also suggests improvements for handling invalid inputs in the `toLocale` method, which shows a good level of analytical depth. However, it does not explicitly address security risks, which is why the security awareness score is lower. The review is constructive and adheres to the guidelines provided, focusing on functional issues rather than style."
