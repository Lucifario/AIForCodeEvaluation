Explanation: The fields method does not check for empty arrays, it should throw an exception if the input array is empty.\n   Suggested Fix: if (fields == null || fields.length == 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"specified fields can't be null or empty\"); }\n2. Explanation: The indices method does not check for null input, it should throw an exception if the input is null.\n   Suggested Fix: this.indices = Objects.requireNonNull(indices, \"indices must not be null\");\n3. Explanation: The clusterAlias method does not check if the input is null, it should throw an exception if the input is null.\n   Suggested Fix: void clusterAlias(String clusterAlias) { if (clusterAlias == null) { throw new NullPointerException(\"clusterAlias must not be null\"); } this.clusterAlias = clusterAlias; }",
