Explanation: Missing null check for the indices parameter in the indices(String... indices) method\n   Suggested Fix: public FieldCapabilitiesRequest indices(String... indices) {\n    this.indices = Objects.requireNonNull(indices, \"indices must not be null\");\n    return this;\n}\n3. Explanation: Potential security issue due to the inclusion of the includeIndices flag in the request\n   Suggested Fix: Consider removing the includeIndices flag from the request or making it optional",
