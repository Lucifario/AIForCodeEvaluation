  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The rule does not handle the case where there are multiple remote enriches in the pipeline. It only considers the first one it encounters.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a recursive approach to handle multiple remote enriches, or use a data structure to keep track of the remote enriches encountered so far.\n2. Explanation: The rule does not handle the case where a limit is duplicated, i.e., there are multiple limits with the same value. It will only consider the first one it encounters.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a data structure to keep track of the unique limits encountered so far, and only consider the minimum limit value.\n3. Explanation: The rule does not handle the case where a pipeline breaker is present in the pipeline. It will not consider the limits below the pipeline breaker.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to handle pipeline breakers, and consider the limits below them if they are not on the coordinator.\n4. Explanation: The rule does not handle the case where a limit is not combinable, i.e., it is not a remote enrich. It will not consider the limits below it.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to handle non-combinable limits, and consider the limits below them if they are combinable.\n5. Explanation: The rule does not handle the case where the coordinator is not the correct location for the limit. It will not consider the limits below the executes on coordinator.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to handle the coordinator location, and consider the limits below it if it is the correct location.",
