For example, 'interface members can only be empty property declarations, empty functions{0}' doesn't tell *which* interface or member is the problem without looking at the code. The messages are technically correct *if* the code violates interface rules, but the review doesn't explain *why* those rules exist or how to fix the issue beyond 'make it empty'. There's no root cause analysis, and no security implications are considered. The review doesn't offer any constructive suggestions beyond pointing out the errors. It adheres to any implicit guidelines of simply reporting issues."
