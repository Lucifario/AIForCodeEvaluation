  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input keys are null. This can lead to a NullPointerException when trying to call indexFor() on a null key.\n   Suggested Fix: In the bulkGet() method, add a null check before calling indexFor() on each key.\n2. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input keys are not hashable. This can lead to a ClassCastException when trying to use the keys as indices in the stripes array.\n   Suggested Fix: In the bulkGet() method, add a check to ensure that the keys are hashable before trying to use them as indices.\n3. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input keys are very large. This can lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when trying to access the stripes array with an index that is too large.\n   Suggested Fix: In the bulkGet() method, add a check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the stripes array before trying to access it.\n4. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input keys are very small. This can lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when trying to access the stripes array with an index that is too small.\n   Suggested Fix: In the bulkGet() method, add a check to ensure that the index is non-negative before trying to access the stripes array.\n5. Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input keys are not iterable. This can lead to a NullPointerException when trying to call bulkGet() on a non-iterable object.\n   Suggested Fix: In the bulkGet() method, add a check to ensure that the input keys are iterable before trying to call bulkGet() on them.",
