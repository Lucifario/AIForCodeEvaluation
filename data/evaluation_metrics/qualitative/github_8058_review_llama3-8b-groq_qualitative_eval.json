  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: Potential null pointer exception in stream() method for OptionalInt, OptionalLong, and OptionalDouble. If the optional does not contain a value, calling getAsInt(), getAsLong(), or getAsDouble() will throw a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Use optional.isPresent() to check if the optional contains a value before calling getAsInt(), getAsLong(), or getAsDouble().\n2. Explanation: The closeAll() method catches all exceptions and throws them later. This can make it difficult to diagnose the source of the exception. Consider catching specific exceptions instead.\n   Suggested Fix: Catch specific exceptions instead of catching all exceptions. For example, catch IOException and RuntimeException separately.\n3. Explanation: The concat() method uses a loop to calculate the estimated size of the concatenated stream. This can be inefficient for large streams. Consider using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the estimated size.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the estimated size, such as by summing the estimated sizes of the individual streams.",
