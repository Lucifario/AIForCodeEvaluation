The messages are extremely generic ('lambda is not initialized', 'lambda is not a positive integer') and lack context.  There's no indication of *why* lambda might be uninitialized or invalid. The review is essentially a list of possible exceptions without any supporting evidence or explanation. It's not actionable because it doesn't point to the root cause or suggest fixes. It doesn't demonstrate any analytical depth or security awareness. It's also not constructive; it only points out potential problems without offering solutions. The review does adhere to the requested JSON format."
