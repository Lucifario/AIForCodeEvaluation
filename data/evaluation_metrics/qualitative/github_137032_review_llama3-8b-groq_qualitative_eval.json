  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a large number of enum values which can lead to performance issues and make the code harder to maintain. It would be better to break this down into smaller classes or use a more dynamic approach.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a separate class or a configuration file to manage the capabilities instead of having them as enum values.\n2. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a mix of capabilities that are related to spatial functions and others that are not. It would be better to break this down into smaller classes or use a more modular approach.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider creating separate classes for spatial functions and other capabilities to make the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n3. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a large number of deprecated capabilities. It would be better to remove them or mark them as deprecated to avoid confusion.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider removing or marking as deprecated the capabilities that are no longer supported or have been replaced by newer ones.\n4. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities does not have any checks for null values. It would be better to add null checks to avoid NullPointerExceptions.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider adding null checks for the capabilities and their values to avoid NullPointerExceptions.\n5. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities does not have any security checks. It would be better to add security checks to prevent unauthorized access to capabilities.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider adding security checks to prevent unauthorized access to capabilities and to ensure that only authorized users can access them.",
