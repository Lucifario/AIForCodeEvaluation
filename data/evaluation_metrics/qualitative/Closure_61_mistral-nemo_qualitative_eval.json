This happens when the node type is Token.HOOK and the trueValue equals falseValue.\"\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Null Pointer Exception in getPureBooleanValue() method\",\n    \"line_number\": 48,\n    \"reason\": \"The method tries to access the string value of a node using n.getString() without checking if the node is a NAME node. If the node is not a NAME node, this will throw a Null Pointer Exception.\"\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Inconsistent return types in getStringValue() method\",\n    \"line_number\": 61,\n    \"reason\": \"The method returns a String for some cases, but returns null for others. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior in calling code.\"\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Unused local variable in NodeUtil class\",\n    \"line_number\": 15,\n    \"reason\": \"The variable MAX_POSITIVE_INTEGER_NUMBER is declared but never used. This can be removed to improve code readability and reduce memory usage.\"\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Dead code in getImpureBooleanValue() method\",\n    \"line_number\": 24,\n    \"reason\": \"The switch statement has a default case that does nothing. This can be removed to improve code readability.\"\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Magic number in getStringValue() method\",\n    \"line_number\": 65,\n    \"reason\": \"The method uses the number 3 as a magic number to determine the length of a string. This should be replaced with a named constant to improve code readability and maintainability.\"\n  }\n\n] }",
