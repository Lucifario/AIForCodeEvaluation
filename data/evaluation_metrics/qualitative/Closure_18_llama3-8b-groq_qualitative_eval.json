The suggestions simply state that the types are not defined, without offering any guidance on *why* they might be missing or how to resolve the issue (e.g., import statements, package context). The analytical depth is minimal; it's a surface-level observation. There's no security analysis. Constructiveness is also low, as it's purely pointing out missing definitions. The review adheres to any implicit guidelines (no style concerns were mentioned). The review is essentially a mechanical check for undefined types, which is valid but not particularly insightful."
