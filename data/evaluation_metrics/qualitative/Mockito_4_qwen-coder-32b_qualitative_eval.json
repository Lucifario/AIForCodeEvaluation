  "original_review": "<think>\nOkay, I need to review this Java code for bugs and return a JSON with a list of bugs. Let me start by looking through the code carefully. \n\nFirst, the code is part of the Mockito framework's exceptions package. The class Reporter has several methods that throw various exceptions with formatted messages. \n\nLooking at the methods, they all use the join method from org.mockito.internal.util.StringJoiner. The messages are constructed by joining strings with line breaks. \n\nWait, in the method 'nullPassedToVerify()', the code starts with \"    no```\". That looks like a typo. The line probably started with a closing triple quote from a code block, but it's incomplete. The message should end with something like \"Examples of correct verifications...\" but here it's cut off. That's a bug because the exception message will have an incomplete string, which could confuse users.\n\nAnother thing: in the 'unfinishedStubbing' method, the message includes a hint numbered \" 3: you are stubbing...\" which has a leading space before the number. The other hints are numbered \" 1. \" and \" 2. \". That's inconsistent. It's a minor formatting issue but could be considered a bug in terms of user experience.\n\nIn the 'incorrectUseOfApi' method, the message says \"thenReturn() instruction if completed\". The phrase \"if completed\" seems out of place. Maybe it should be \"is completed\"? The wording here is a bit confusing, possibly a typo.\n\nLooking at the 'missingMethodInvocation' method, the message mentions \"NON_PUBLIC_PARENT\" as a constant. I need to check if that's correctly referenced. The code has \"MockitoLimitations.NON_PUBLIC_PARENT\", which is a string. If that's a static field in MockitoLimitations, it's okay. But if it's supposed to be a formatted string, maybe it should be enclosed in quotes or formatted differently. However, since it's part of the message as a note, perhaps it's intentional. Not sure if that's a bug.\n\nIn the 'unfinishedVerificationException' method, the message includes \"Also, this error might show up because you verify either of: final/private/equals()/hashCode() methods.\" But the next line says \"Those methods *cannot* be stubbed/verified.\" That's correct, but the message could be clearer. However, that's more of a documentation issue than a bug in the code.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the 'notAMockPassedToVerify' method, the message says \"Make sure you place the parenthesis correctly!\" Maybe they meant parentheses, plural. That's a typo.\n\nNow, checking for possible exceptions or errors in the code structure. All the methods throw exceptions with messages built using StringJoiner's join method. The join method probably appends lines with newlines. So if the messages have trailing empty strings in the arguments, like in 'unfinishedStubbing' where there's an empty string at the end, that would add an extra newline. Not sure if that's intended, but it's part of the message formatting. If the messages are supposed to end with a blank line, it's okay. Otherwise, it's a formatting issue.\n\nAlso, looking for possible NPEs. For example, in 'notAMockPassedToVerify', they use type.getSimpleName(). If 'type' is null, that would cause a NPE. But the method is called when a non-mock is passed to verify, so 'type' is the class of the object passed, which shouldn't be null. So that's probably safe.\n\nAnother thing: in 'unfinishedStubbing', the message includes \"you are trying to stub a final method, you naughty developer!\" The exclamation mark is after the comma. It should probably be \"you naughty developer!\" without the comma. Or maybe the comma is intentional for the message style. Not sure if that's a bug, but it's a grammatical error.\n\nNow, compiling all these observations into a list of bugs.\n\n1. In 'nullPassedToVerify()', the message ends with \"    no```\" which is incomplete. It should probably end with the examples of correct verifications.\n\n2. In 'unfinishedStubbing', the third hint is numbered \" 3: \" with a space before the number, while others are \" 1. \" and \" 2. \".\n\n3. In 'incorrectUseOfApi', the phrase \"thenReturn() instruction if completed\" might be a typo and should be \"thenReturn() instruction is completed\".\n\n4. In 'notAMockPassedToVerify', \"parenthesis\" should be \"parentheses\".\n\n5. In 'unfinishedStubbing', the message has an empty string at the end of the join arguments, causing an extra newline. Maybe that's intentional, but it's a formatting inconsistency.\n\n6. In 'unfinishedStubbing', the comma in \"you naughty developer!\" after \"method, you\" is incorrect. It should probably be a period or the comma removed.\n\nI'll need to check each of these to confirm if they are actual bugs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bugs\": [\n    {\n      \"line_number\": 115,\n      \"method\": \"nullPassedToVerify\",\n      \"description\": \"Incomplete message ends with 'no```' which is likely a typo.

The reviewer correctly points out the incomplete message, inconsistent numbering, potential typos, and formatting inconsistencies. The analysis is good, though it doesn't delve deeply into the underlying code logic beyond the message strings themselves. Security isn't addressed at all, which is understandable given the context of exception messages. The suggestions are actionable, although some are minor stylistic preferences. The review is constructive and focuses on improving the user experience through clearer and more consistent error messages. The review followed the constraints by focusing on the provided code snippet."
