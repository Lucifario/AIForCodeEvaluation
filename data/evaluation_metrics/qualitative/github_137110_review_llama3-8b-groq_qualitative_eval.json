  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a large number of enum values, which can lead to performance issues and make the code harder to maintain. It's recommended to split it into smaller enums or use a different data structure.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider splitting the enum into smaller enums, e.g., EsqlSpatialCapabilities, EsqlAggregationCapabilities, etc.\n2. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a mix of enum values with different purposes (e.g., feature flags, spatial capabilities, aggregation capabilities). It's recommended to separate these into different enums or classes.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider creating separate enums or classes for different types of capabilities, e.g., EsqlFeatureFlags, EsqlSpatialCapabilities, EsqlAggregationCapabilities, etc.\n3. Explanation: The class EsqlCapabilities has a large number of enum values with long descriptions. It's recommended to use a more concise description or use a separate data structure for the descriptions.\n   Suggested Fix: Consider using a more concise description or a separate data structure for the descriptions, e.g., a map with enum values as keys and descriptions as values.",
