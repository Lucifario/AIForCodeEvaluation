        "reasoning": "The review is technically accurate and provides specific lines where issues are identified. It suggests concrete actions, such as checking for NaN or infinite values and replacing custom exceptions with standard ones. The review also delves into the root causes of potential issues, such as invalid input values. However, it does not explicitly mention security risks, although the suggestions indirectly improve security by preventing invalid inputs. The review is constructive and offers improvements rather than just criticism. It adheres to the constraints by focusing on bugs without addressing style issues."
