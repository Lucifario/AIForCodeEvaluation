        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies a potential issue in the `add` methods regarding negative month values. It's likely that the current implementation doesn't handle subtracting months correctly, potentially leading to incorrect date calculations. The severity is appropriately marked as LOW. However, the description is a bit vague; it states the method *should* return the last day of the previous month, but doesn't explain *why* or provide a specific example of the incorrect behavior. It would be more actionable with a test case or a more detailed explanation of the expected outcome. There's no security implication identified. The review is constructive in pointing out a potential bug, but could be improved with more detail. The review adheres to any implicit guidelines (no style concerns were mentioned)."
