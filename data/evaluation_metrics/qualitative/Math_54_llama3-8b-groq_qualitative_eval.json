        "reasoning": "The review identifies valid code smells and missing methods. The suggestions regarding static fields and string constants are reasonable, though whether they are *necessary* depends on the broader design. The missing constructor, equals, and hashCode methods are standard practices for a well-behaved class. However, the review lacks depth; it points out *what* is missing or smells, but doesn't explain *why* these are particularly problematic in this context (e.g., immutability concerns with static fields, the importance of equals/hashCode for a numerical class). It's also a bit superficial - suggesting a constructor with radix/minExponent parameters without considering the existing design or potential implications. Security is entirely ignored, which is not ideal even for a math library. The tone is neutral and constructive, but could be improved by explaining the benefits of the suggested changes. The review doesn't mention any constraints, so adherence is perfect."
