Explanation: The code snippet does not handle the case where the 'builder()' method returns null, which could lead to a NullPointerException when calling methods like 'typeName()' or 'esType()'.\n   Suggested Fix: DataType UNSUPPORTED = builder().typeName(\"UNSUPPORTED\").estimatedSize(1024).supportedOnAllNodes(); if (UNUPPORTED == null) { throw new IllegalStateException(\"Builder returned null\"); }\n2. Explanation: The 'builder()' method is not checked for null before calling methods like 'typeName()' or 'esType()', which could lead to a NullPointerException if the builder is not properly initialized.\n   Suggested Fix: DataType UNSUPPORTED = builder().typeName(\"UNSUPPORTED\").estimatedSize(1024).supportedOnAllNodes(); if (builder() == null) { throw new IllegalStateException(\"Builder is not initialized\"); }\n3. Explanation: The 'estimatedSize' method is called with a constant value (1024) without checking if the type is supported on all nodes, which could lead to inconsistent behavior.\n   Suggested Fix: DataType UNSUPPORTED = builder().typeName(\"UNSUPPORTED\").estimatedSize(UNUPPORTED.supportedOnAllNodes() ? 1024 : 0).supportedOnAllNodes();",
