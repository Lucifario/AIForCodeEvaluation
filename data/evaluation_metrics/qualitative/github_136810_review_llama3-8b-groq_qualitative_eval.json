  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The static block is not thread-safe. It's using a HashSet to store settings, but it's not synchronized. This can lead to concurrent modification exceptions when multiple threads try to access the settings.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a thread-safe collection like CopyOnWriteArraySet to store the settings.\n2. Explanation: The IndexScopedSettings class is not thread-safe. It's not synchronized, and it's not immutable. This can lead to unexpected behavior when multiple threads try to access the settings.\n   Suggested Fix: Make the class immutable by removing the static block and using a thread-safe collection. Alternatively, synchronize the class using a lock or a synchronized block.",
