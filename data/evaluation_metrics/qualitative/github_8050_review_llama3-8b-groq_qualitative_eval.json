  "original_review": "Bugs Found:\n1. Explanation: The method toImmutableSet() does not handle the case where the input stream contains duplicate elements. It will only keep the first occurrence of each element.\n   Suggested Fix: Use a Collector that removes duplicates, such as Collectors.toSet() or Collectors.toCollection(HashSet::new)\n2. Explanation: The of() methods do not handle the case where the input array is null. They will throw a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling the of() methods, and return an empty set if the input array is null.\n3. Explanation: The copyOf() method does not handle the case where the input collection is null. It will throw a NullPointerException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a null check before calling the copyOf() method, and return an empty set if the input collection is null.\n4. Explanation: The of() methods with varargs do not handle the case where the input array is too large. They will throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n   Suggested Fix: Add a check to ensure that the input array is not too large before calling the of() methods with varargs.",
