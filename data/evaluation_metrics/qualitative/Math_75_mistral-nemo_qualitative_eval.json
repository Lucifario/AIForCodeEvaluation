        "reasoning": "The review correctly identifies numerous missing methods that would be expected in a comprehensive `Frequency` class. The suggestions regarding deprecated methods are also accurate. However, the review is almost entirely a list of 'missing method' observations. While factually correct, it lacks depth in *why* these methods are important for a Frequency class beyond simply stating they are missing. The actionability is low because it just states what's missing, not *how* to implement them. There's no discussion of potential algorithms or edge cases. Security is not addressed at all. Constructiveness is moderate; it points out what *should* be there, but doesn't offer guidance on implementation. The review adheres to any implicit guidelines (no style comments were requested)."
