        "reasoning": "The review is highly accurate in identifying missing overrides (`toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`) and a potentially unused constructor. The observation about `peg()` being undefined is also correct. The suggestions are actionable - a developer could readily implement the missing methods and consider removing the constructor. The analytical depth is moderate; it identifies *what* is missing but doesn't deeply analyze the impact of these omissions beyond debugging/consistency. Security isn't addressed, which is acceptable given the context. The tone is constructive, focusing on improvements rather than simply pointing out flaws. The review doesn't appear to have any constraints, so adherence is perfect."
